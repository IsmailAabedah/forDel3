# ZhongHong Android Head Unit — Integration Handoff (revision 4, verified by a full drive test) v2

> **Consolidated update: 30 October 2026.** This v2 is based on the latest available `ZhongHong_HeadUnit_Integration_Handoff_VERIFIED.md` plus the 28 October verification addendum, the 29–30 October CarCheck review, and the subsequent Bluetooth/GOC source analysis. The exact file named `ZhongHong_HeadUnit_Integration_Handoff_v2.md` was not present in the available file set, so the latest VERIFIED copy was used as the base rather than an older draft.
> **Read first:** Appendix H (Bluetooth music/steering-wheel path), Appendix I (corrected 32-bit odometer and maintenance calculation), and Appendix J (agreed launcher feature scope). These updates supersede conflicting older statements in the baseline.

Purpose: give another AI/developer everything needed to talk to **every unit of this car's head unit** from a normal Android app (a custom launcher / dashboard). It is built from (a) the factory APKs pulled from the unit, decompiled and read, and (b) on-device probe reports produced by a probe app running as a normal app.

> **Verification update (2026-10-28):** This handoff has been reconciled with `carcheck_20261027_224456.txt`. Read the updated Section 5 and Appendix G before implementation; they supersede older `[UNTESTED]` notes where the device probe now provides evidence. The full per-signal evidence and remaining gaps are in Appendix G.

## 0. Scope, legend, ground rules

**Confidence tags used everywhere**

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[CODE]` | Read directly in decompiled factory code (descriptors, transaction codes, constants, bit positions). High confidence on *format*. |
| `[DEVICE]` | Observed on the real unit in a probe report. |
| `[UNTESTED]` | Reachability or behaviour from a *third-party app* was never tried on the device. Treat as "should work, verify first". |
| `[NOT FOUND]` | Looked for it in the provided APKs and it is not there. |

**Ground rules**
- Target process: a normal app (uid `u0_aXX`, `untrusted_app`), `targetSdkVersion 22` (so all manifest permissions are granted at install; there is no runtime-permission UI to rely on).
- Out of scope: rooting, privilege escalation, modifying the system partition, or anything that needs system UID. Everything below uses interfaces that are exported/world-accessible or readable by any app.
- The third-party launcher `com.wicardtech.wicardcl` (QuickSmartDrive) was **deliberately not analysed or used**. Nothing here comes from it.
- Privacy: device serial number, device ID and GPS coordinates seen in the raw reports were removed.
- Language of the car: system locale `fa-IR`, time zone `Asia/Tehran`. The owner's UI language is Arabic (UI text is the app's own choice, independent of the system locale).

## 0.1 Project brief and agreed product scope (owner requirements; not all features are technically verified)

The target is a **standalone native Android launcher/dashboard APK** for the Saipa Quick Automatic Full Plus head unit. The app must run as an ordinary third-party app; do not require root, system UID, changes to `/system`, a paid API, or a modified firmware image. Kotlin is the preferred implementation language. Keep the code modular so each hardware/service integration can be tested independently.

### Agreed UI/UX requirements
- Arabic is the launcher's UI language; the head unit's system locale remains `fa-IR` and its timezone is `Asia/Tehran`. Do not assume that setting the UI language requires changing Android's system locale.
- Design for a fixed **952×600 px**, landscape, 7-inch display (~634×400 dp at density 1.5). Prioritise readable text, large touch targets, strong contrast and a low-clutter driving dashboard.
- Provide **multiple genuinely different dashboard layouts** (different composition, widget placement and hierarchy), not just several colour palettes. Colour themes may be an additional independent setting.
- Provide automatic day/night styling using the tested illumination callback where appropriate, plus a manual override.
- Optional startup greeting using the spoken Arabic greeting/name “إسماعيل”, controlled by a setting/toggle. Availability/quality of Arabic TTS on this Android image must be tested; allow a local recorded-voice fallback.
- Optional Arabic voice alerts for confirmed vehicle events (initial example: “الباب مفتوح”). Make alerts configurable, debounce them, avoid repeated announcements while a door remains open, and do not announce uncertain signals. TTS/voice playback itself is not yet tested.
- The final deliverable expected by the owner is an installable **APK**. Keep a reproducible source project/build for maintenance; do not make the runtime app depend on a cloud API.

### Agreed dashboard/features list and current feasibility

| Feature | Agreed product intent | Current evidence / implementation constraint |
|---|---|---|
| Main vehicle dashboard | Gear, speed, odometer, doors, lights/indicators, handbrake/brake, temperature and TPMS where reliable | Doors/lights/brake/handbrake/gear have useful signals. Speed requires a moving log. Odometer is decoded in Appendix I and needs cluster sanity-check. TPMS conversion is in Appendix A; use factory configuration/self-localisation/error gating. |
| Gear display | P / R / N / D | Strongly supported CAN mapping: 9=P, 10=R, 11=N, 12=D. For reverse transitions use Logic/SystemState `back` callback as the primary signal and preserve the factory camera. |
| Door status and voice alert | Individual door open/closed states and optional Arabic voice warning | Four side-door fields were physically exercised: `0=open`, `1=closed`. Trunk/bonnet were not separately tested; do not add until verified. |
| Seat belts | No seat-belt section in the launcher's product UI | Explicitly agreed: **omit both driver and passenger seat-belt UI**. Driver signals changed in one test, but that does not override the UI decision. |
| Passenger airbag | Keep passenger-airbag on/off setting/status accessible | The owner reports this control/status exists in the factory Car Settings screen. Preserve a direct entry point to that factory screen. Do not infer airbag health/cutoff from unverified frame-722 bits. |
| Wipers/windows | Not a requested launcher feature | Omit wiper/window widgets and controls. The recorded tests produced no useful transitions and the owner reports these sensors are not usable on this vehicle. |
| TPMS | Wheel pressure/temperature/status if valid | Factory decode formulas exist. Do not show a wheel unless vehicle TPMS configuration and self-localisation conditions are met and no sensor error is active. Verify units/display formatting on the car. |
| Ambient temperature | Read and display outside temperature | Factory formula is `raw * 0.5 - 40`; this log oscillated between 15°C and 16°C. Use smoothing and an unavailable sentinel check. |
| USB music | Display current track and offer transport controls | Binder binding and listener registration worked; actual play/pause/next/previous commands were not exercised. Use the factory list/activity as a fallback. |
| Bluetooth phone music — Level 3 | Phone audio continues in the background while launcher remains visible; integrated controls; physical steering-wheel buttons; ideally track/artist/album/artwork | GOC stack internally supports A2DP and parses metadata. Steering-wheel routing is statically traced via EasyConnected + Logic and needs on-device validation. External metadata and touchscreen transport are **not solved**; cover art is not present in `BaseId3Info`. See Appendix H. |
| Radio | Radio status/launch/controls | MCU radio read-all works but radio was off, and keyed `getfreq` failed. Use factory radio Activity until tuning/control is verified. |
| Video/pictures/AUX | Quick entry points; inline video was considered | Factory activities are available. Current video AIDL service has no Binder (`onBind()` returns null); inline/PiP playback inside launcher is not established. |
| Navigation | Quick access to Neshan, Google Maps and Target/Polnav; coexistence with music | Apps are installed/resolvable. `STREAM_NAVI=10` and `navi_mix_value` are useful integration clues. Test actual navigation audio mixing. Never cover reverse camera. |
| Phone UI | Incoming-call indication, contacts, recent/missed calls, answer/reject and dialling where possible | Current external call-control Binder is absent; provider cursors were null/empty in the probe. Use factory BT dialer/call UI as fallback. Do not promise a custom contact/call-log panel until access is proven. |
| App shortcuts/settings | Launch installed apps and factory system pages | Useful because Play Store is absent/non-working and factory apps are hidden from the stock app drawer. |

### Product safety/behaviour rules
- Reverse camera has priority. When reverse is detected, let the factory camera/activity/overlay own the display. Do not show a full-screen launcher overlay or consume touch input over the camera.
- Do not show unsupported or uncalibrated values as if they were reliable. In particular: vehicle speed until tested while moving; raw airbag diagnostic states; passenger belt; wipers/windows; and unverified lock/key states.
- Keep factory call UI available until a reliable external call-state and call-control mechanism is proven. Avoid duplicating the factory call screen with a second overlay.
- Prefer event callbacks over tight polling. Unregister callbacks cleanly and handle process/service disconnection/reconnection.

## 1. Device and system facts `[DEVICE]`

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Model / board | `AOSP on zh_dragon`, board/hardware `zh_dragon`, manufacturer `NEXELL`; CarCheck also reports `ro.board.platform=s5p4418`. Vendor properties/namespaces contain `nxp4330` references, but those references alone do **not** establish the physical SoC. |
| Android | 7.1.2 (SDK 25), build `N2G48H`, `userdebug`, `release-keys` |
| Fingerprint | `Android/aosp_zh_dragon/zh_dragon:7.1.2/N2G48H/builde02141541:userdebug/release-keys` |
| ABI | `armeabi-v7a`, `armeabi` only (**32-bit**; no arm64) |
| Screen | 952 x 600 px, density 1.5 (240 dpi bucket), ~634 x 400 dp, landscape, 7 inch |
| SELinux | `ro.boot.selinux = permissive` (so SELinux is not what blocks binder/service lookups) |
| Process context of probe | `uid=10030(u0_a30)`, `untrusted_app`, groups `net_bt_admin(3001)`, `net_bt(3002)`, `inet(3003)`, `everybody(9997)` |
| Default HOME | not set: `ResolverActivity` chooser. HOME candidates: `com.zhonghong.launcher/.activity.LauncherActivity`, the custom app, `com.wicardtech.wicardcl` (QuickSmartDrive), `com.android.settings/.FallbackHome`. `persist.sys.default.launcher` points at the factory launcher |
| Input / UI | `persist.zh.force_no_anim=true`, `persist.zh.forced_no_orient=true`, `ro.zh.inputmethodbottom=30` |
| Audio | `ro.zh.multi.audio_channel=true`; `persist.sys.max_*` (music, navi, tts, voice_call, alarm, ring, system, notification, bluetooth_sco, dtmf) are all **30**; `persist.sys.default_navi=18`, `persist.sys.default_voice_call=20`. A custom navigation audio stream exists: `STREAM_NAVI = 10` `[CODE]` |
| Locale / TZ | `fa-IR`, `Asia/Tehran` |
| Media codecs (boot props) | ext audio `ape,wma,ac3`; ext video `avi,flv,ts,mkv,rm,rmvb,asf,wmv` |
| Storage | internal `/sdcard` (FUSE, `/storage/emulated`); USB sticks appear as `/storage/udisk1`, `/storage/udisk2` (vfat, mounted from `/mnt/media_rw/udiskN`). App-private dirs on USB: `/storage/udiskN/Android/data/<pkg>/files` are writable; the USB root generally is not for a normal app |
| Misc facts | `persist.phone.easyconnect=true` (phone-mirroring app present); `sys.btcall`, `sys.carlifevr`, `zh.navi.pidlist` props exist (see section 8); `persist.sys.usb.config=adb` and a functionfs `adb` mount exist in the property/mount tables (reported as facts only; no developer-options UI is exposed to the user) |

### Hardware ports `[DEVICE]`
Kernel props: `ro.kernel.android.gps=ttyAMA0`, **`ro.kernel.android.mcu=ttyAMA2`**, `ro.kernel.android.bt=goc_serial`, `ro.mcu.baudRate=2`.
`/dev/ttyAMA0..4` are `crw-rw-rw- system system` (world read/write). `ttyAMA0` carries standard NMEA GPS sentences (`$GNGGA…`). `ttyAMA2` is the MCU link (first run sample began `FF AA 50 00 …`, second run was idle). `ttyAMA1` carries C0-delimited binary frames (looks SLIP-like, e.g. `C0 D3 74 00 B8 13 05 01 02 00 01 00 FB 69 C0`), purpose not identified. `ttyAMA3`/`ttyAMA4` idle. `/dev/i2c-*` are root-only. `usb_i2c` is world rw (purpose unknown).
**Do not read or write these ports in production**: the factory MCU service owns them, and reading steals bytes from it. Use the binder interfaces below instead.

### System services registered in ServiceManager (`service list`) `[DEVICE]`
`_logic_service` (`com.logic.common.aidl.ILogicInterface`), `zhonghong.mcu` (`android.zhonghong.IMcuService`), `zhupdate_service` (`com.zhonghong.update.aidl.IUpdateInterface`). The names `zhbt_service` and `zh_can_service` that the factory code looks up were **not** present in either `service list` snapshot, see section 3.

### Installed packages (non-AOSP) `[DEVICE]`
All factory packages are `SYSTEM`; most run as `android.uid.system`. Third party: `com.estrongs.android.pop` (ES File Explorer), `com.xbrowser.play` (X Browser), `com.chartcross.gpstest` (GPS Test), `com.polstar.polnav6` (navigation, "Target"), `org.rajman.neshan.traffic.tehran.navigator` (Neshan), `net.easyconn` (EasyConnected phone mirroring), `com.persian.keyboard…`, plus the user-installed launchers. Full package list with versions is in section 2.

### Things a normal app can / cannot do on this unit `[DEVICE]`
- Can: be a HOME candidate (it appears in the chooser), launch every factory activity and the hidden system apps (ES, X Browser, GPS Test, Android Settings), bind exported factory services, read exported content providers, read `Settings.System`, read system properties.
- Factory apps are not visible in any system app drawer; they only appear through a launcher that lists all `LAUNCHER` activities.
- Installing APKs is only possible through the ES file explorer / package installer launched from a custom launcher (no store, no stock file manager UI).

## 3. How to connect to everything (the connection map)

### 3.0 Reachability matrix

| # | Unit / data | How to reach it | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Vehicle state from CAN (doors, lights, TPMS, ambient temp, ODO, vehicle speed, gear lever, PEPS/keyless, wipers, locks, windows) | `bindService` to `com.zhonghong.can` / `com.zhonghong.can.CanService`, AIDL `ICanInterface` (section 3.1) | `[DEVICE]` bind/read/callback confirmed from a normal third-party app; check Section 3.1 and Appendix G for signal-by-signal confidence |
| 2 | System state: ACC, power, reverse (parking), AVM, illumination, running, audio source/focus | System service `_logic_service` via hidden `ServiceManager.getService` (section 3.2) | `[DEVICE]` getter calls and callbacks work from a normal third-party app; command writes remain untested. Easy fallback: Settings.System `back_state` (section 3.9) |
| 3 | MCU: volume, mute, EQ, balance/fade, brightness, TFT, beep, radio, hard keys, power/ACC/ILL JSON | System service `zhonghong.mcu` (section 3.3) | `[DEVICE]` domain read-all and selected keyed reads work from a normal third-party app; write operations remain untested |
| 4 | Bluetooth phone/music control | Internal GOC stack in `com.zhonghong.bluetooth`; the only currently promising external steering-key route is `net.easyconn.a2dp.acquire` → `BtMusicAudioHelper` → Logic source callback (Section 3.4 / Appendix H). | `[CODE]` path traced; **not yet runtime-tested**. `zhbt_service` lookup is null and the ordinary declared BT service binds to no Binder. Touchscreen BT transport and external ID3 access remain unresolved. |
| 5 | BT status/metadata, BT music info | Broker callbacks / `Settings.System` for coarse connection and call state; GOC `MI` parser inside the BT process for title/artist/album; `btinfo` provider (3.4). | `[DEVICE]` coarse connection/call signals readable; provider metadata is null/contacts empty. GOC internally parses ID3, but no usable external interface exposes it to the launcher. |
| 6 | Phone book + call log | ContentProvider `content://com.car.phone_data/{contacts,call_log,contacts_favorite}` (3.4) | `[CODE]` exported, no permission; `[DEVICE]` contacts/call-log queries returned null cursors in the probe, so custom lists are not yet supported. |
| 7 | USB music (metadata + play/pause/next/prev) | bind `com.zhonghong.yzmusic` / `com.zhonghong.music.model.service.UsbMusicService` (3.5) | `[DEVICE]` bind and listener registration succeeded; actual transport buttons remain untested. |
| 8 | USB video control | Factory activity `com.zhonghong.video_activity`; declared service `com.zhonghong.yzvideo.service.VideoService` (3.5) | `[DEVICE]` bind request returned true but no connection; `[CODE]` current service `onBind()` returns null. Use factory activity; embedded controls are not available yet. |
| 9 | Media library (audio/video/image/txt on USB) | ContentProvider `content://com.zhonghong.media/{audio,video,image,txt,id3,scan_state}` (3.5) | `[CODE]` exported |
| 10 | System state broker (ACC, volume, BT state, back, headlamp, network, TUID) | bind `com.zhonghong.aidlserver.service.SystemStateService` / `SystemStateService2` (3.6) | `[CODE]` exported (process `:systemstate`) |
| 11 | Radio high-level AIDL / BT-music AIDL | AIDL interfaces `IRadioAidlInterface`, `IBtMusicAidlInterface` exist in the music app | `[NOT FOUND]` no server for them in the provided APKs; use MCU domain 1 for the radio |
| 12 | Key / MultiScreen / Navi / ExtraAudioDevice AIDL (`KeyInterface`, `ScreenInterface`, `NaviInterface`, `ExtraDeviceInterface`) | SDK interfaces bundled in several apps | `[NOT FOUND]` no server and no user in the provided APKs |
| 13 | Screen off / beep / other broadcasts | Broadcast intents received by the Logic app (3.8) | `[CODE]` |
| 14 | Factory screens (radio, USB music/video/pictures, BT dial/music/settings, system settings, EQ, car settings, AUX, update) | `startActivity` with the actions in 3.8 | `[CODE]` |
| 15 | Phone call state quick check | system property `sys.btcall` (`"true"` during a BT call) | `[CODE]` set by BT app; easy to read |
| 16 | BT connection / signal / battery for status bar | `Settings.System` keys `bt_connected`, `key_bluetooth_state`, `key_signal_state`, `key_battery_state` | `[CODE]` |
| 17 | Raw serial ports | `/dev/ttyAMA0..4` | `[DEVICE]` world rw, but **do not use** (section 1) |

**Standard AIDL call recipe (everything marked "standard AIDL" below).**
```
Parcel d = Parcel.obtain(), r = Parcel.obtain();
d.writeInterfaceToken(DESCRIPTOR);
d.writeInt(...)/writeString(...)/writeStrongBinder(cb);       // arguments in declared order
binder.transact(TRANSACTION_CODE, d, r, 0);
r.readException();                                             // then read the return value from r
```
A callback is a `Binder` subclass with `attachInterface(null, CALLBACK_DESCRIPTOR)`; in `onTransact(code,data,reply,flags)` call `data.enforceInterface(CALLBACK_DESCRIPTOR)`, read the arguments, then `reply.writeNoException()`.
Hidden service lookup: `Class.forName("android.os.ServiceManager").getMethod("getService", String.class).invoke(null, name)` (reflection is allowed on SDK 25).
Always run binder calls off the main thread.

### 3.1 CAN service (`com.zhonghong.can`)  [CODE]

- Bind: `new Intent().setClassName("com.zhonghong.can","com.zhonghong.can.CanService")` (intent action `com.zhonghong.intent.action.can`). Factory clients first try system service name `zh_can_service`, which is not registered on this unit `[DEVICE]`, then fall back to this bind.
- Descriptor `com.zhonghong.cancommon.ICanInterface` (standard AIDL):

| Code | Method |
|---|---|
| 1 | `registerCallback(ICanDataCallback)` |
| 2 | `unregisterCallback(ICanDataCallback)` |
| 3 | `execCmd(int cmd, String value)` |
| 4 | `execExtraCmd(int cmd, String value, String extra)` |
| 5 | `ElementData getElementDataInfo(int moduleType)` |

- Callback descriptor `com.zhonghong.cancommon.ICanDataCallback`: code 1 `onCanDataNotify(int moduleType)` (call `getElementDataInfo(moduleType)` again when it fires).
- `getElementDataInfo` reply (after `readException()`): `int hasValue`; if non-zero an `ElementData` follows: `int size`, then `size` times { `int frameId`; `int len` (written as a Parcel byte); if `len>0` a Parcel byte-array (`int length` + bytes) }.
- Module types: **1** CarSet (frames 963, 800, 722, 1219, 1218), **2** TPMS (1042, 1043), **3** CarStatus (564, 577), **4** AmbientTemp (695).
- Frame layout: `byte[]` of a frame = 3 header bytes (frame id low/high + 1 byte) then 8 data bytes. Data bit access is Intel/little-endian over the data bytes:
  `value = sum( bit(i) << i )` where bit `i` is at absolute bit position `(3 + byteIdx) * 8 + startBit + i` of the array (bit 0 = LSB of each byte). Verified identical to the factory routine on 22,000 random inputs.
- The full field table (every named signal with byte/bit/length) is in **Appendix A**.
- **Decoded semantics confirmed from the factory car-settings UI code (`com.zhonghong.carsetting`)** `[CODE]`:
  - Doors (frame 564, byte 1, bits 0..5 = front-left/driver, front-right, rear-left, rear-right, trunk, bonnet): **value 0 = OPEN, 1 = closed**.
  - Hand brake (564, byte 4 bit 2) `==1` = engaged. Reverse gear (564, byte 4 bit 3) `==1`.
  - Tyre pressure bar = `ceil(raw * 1.378 + 100) / 100` (one decimal). Tyre temperature °C = `raw - 40`.
  - Tyre pressure status: 0 normal, 1 very low, 2 slightly low, 3 slightly high, 4 very high. Tyre temperature status: 0 normal, 3 slightly high, 4 very high. `TPMSError==1` sensor error; `AirLeakError==1` leak; `SensorLowBattery==1`.
  - A wheel is shown only when `PEPS_TPMSSystemConfiguration == 1` (frame 1043 byte 5 bits 0-1) **and** that wheel's `SelfLocalizationStatus == 1` (frame 1043 byte 4, 2 bits per wheel) **and** no `TPMSError`.
  - Ambient temperature °C = `raw * 0.5 - 40`; raw `>= 254` means not available.
  - `Start_Switch_Status` and `PowerDistributionStatus`: values 2 or 3 mean "on".
- **Device-tested:** lamp switch/output polarity for tested position/low/high/fog lamps; four side-door open/closed polarity; brake pedal; handbrake; and the strongly supported gear-selector mapping (see Appendix G). The driver-belt bits changed in the probe, but **the agreed launcher UI must omit the entire seat-belt section**. **Still unresolved:** passenger-belt signals; speed while moving/units; `KeyPositionStatus`; airbag diagnostic semantics; wiper/window signals (no useful physical transitions were established). Odometer interpretation is updated in Appendix I: the raw 32-bit value and factory formula yield 34,984 km; compare with the instrument cluster before treating it as field-verified.
- `execCmd` / `execExtraCmd`: the code routes commands (range 100–199, "CarSet", CAN module id 1333, 7 data bytes) to a sender registry, but **no concrete sender class is shipped** in this APK `[NOT FOUND]`. Assume it does nothing. This unit's CAN integration is effectively **read-only**.

### 3.2 Logic service (`_logic_service`)  [CODE] + [DEVICE]

- Obtain: `ServiceManager.getService("_logic_service")` (listed in `service list`).
- Descriptor `com.logic.common.aidl.ILogicInterface` (standard AIDL):

| Code | Method |
|---|---|
| 1 | `registerLogicCallback(int domain, ILogicCallback cb)` |
| 2 | `unregisterLogicCallback(int domain, ILogicCallback cb)` |
| 3 | `setCmd(String cmd, String value, String extra)` |
| 4 | `String getValue(String key, String extra)` |

- Callback descriptor `com.logic.common.aidl.ILogicCallback`: code 1 `onEventChanged(String event, String value, String extra)`. **`registerLogicCallback(domain, cb)` is domain-specific (corrected in revision 4, verified by the full-drive log):** domain **1** = state events (`onAccStateChanged`, `onPowerStateChanged`, `onBackStateChanged`, `onAvmStateChanged`, `onRunningStateChanged`, `onIllStateChanged`, `onAuxStateChanged`); domain **2** = source events (`onSourceChanged`, `onThirdSourceChanged`, `onFoucsStateChanged`, `receiverFoucsStateChanged`, `onMediaButtonPressed`); domains 3 (key) and 4 (setting) are declared but **not routed** in this build, so `onKeyEvent`, `onTftStateChanged`, `onBrightChanged` never arrive. The field test registered domain 1 only and received ACC, back and illumination events; it never saw source or media-button events because domain 2 was not registered. A launcher must register **both** domains (1 and 2).
- `setCmd` implemented: `setSourceId` (value = source id as decimal string), `releaseSourceId`, `closeSourceId`. The constants `setBright`, `setVolume`, `setAutoBright`, `setVolumeChange` exist but are **not handled** by this binder; use the MCU service or `Settings.System` for brightness/volume.
- `getValue` implemented (returns the decimal/boolean text): `getSourceId`, `getThirdSourceId`, `hasFocusById` (extra = id), `getFocusStateById` (extra = id), `getFocusState`, `getAvmState`, `isAccOn`, `isAuxState`, `isIllon`, `isInBackState`, `isPowerOn`, `isRunning`.
- Events (values are strings such as `"true"/"false"` or ints): `onAccStateChanged`, `onPowerStateChanged`, `onBackStateChanged` (reverse gear/parking), `onAvmStateChanged`, `onRunningStateChanged`, `onIllStateChanged` (illumination/lights switch), `onAuxStateChanged`, `onSourceChanged`, `onThirdSourceChanged`, `onFoucsStateChanged`, `receiverFoucsStateChanged`, `onTftStateChanged`, `onBrightChanged`, `onBrightModeChanged`, `onKeyEvent`, `onMediaButtonPressed`.
- Audio source ids: radio 0, music 1, video 2, BT music 3, online music 4, online radio 5, news 6, online program 7, online video 8, SD music 9, SD video 10, AUX 11, CarLife 12, BT phone 13, voice 14, third-party audio app 15, null 4096, off(ARM) 4097, off(MCU) 4098, other app 4099.
- Reverse camera behaviour `[CODE]`: the video switch is done by the hardware/factory logic. While reversing the Logic app writes `Settings.System "back_state" = "true"/"false"` and shows a transparent touch-blocking layer (`BackcarTransParentLayer`). A third-party launcher must not cover the camera view; it can only observe `back_state` / `onBackStateChanged`. The factory logic does not obviously duck other apps' audio in the code read (not verified).

---

### 3.3 MCU service (`zhonghong.mcu`)  [CODE] + [DEVICE]

- Obtain: `ServiceManager.getService("zhonghong.mcu")` (listed in `service list`). Descriptor `android.zhonghong.IMcuService`.
- **Non-standard wire format (no exception header in replies).**

| Code | Call | Request parcel | Reply |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | `getTest()` | token | int |
| 3 | `obtainInfo(domain, cmd, in, out)` | token, `writeInt(domain)`, `writeInt(cmd)`, then the raw data of the `in` parcel appended | the `out` parcel data followed by a final `int` result (1 = ok). Read `out` as the first `dataSize-4` bytes; read the result at `dataSize-4` |
| 4 | `sendInfo(domain, cmd, p)` | token, `writeInt(domain)`, `writeInt(cmd)`, raw data of `p` appended | one `int` (1 = ok) |
| 5 | `registDataChangedListener(domain, IDataChangedListener)` | token, `writeInt(domain)`, `writeStrongBinder(listener)` | int |
| 6 | `unregistDataChangedListener(domain, listener)` | same | int |

  Listener descriptor `android.zhonghong.IDataChangedListener`: code 2 `notify(int domain, int cmd, int arg, Parcel data)`.
- **JSON conventions (all current settings/state live behind these):**
  - *Write*: `sendInfo(domain, 1, p)` where `p` contains `writeByteArray(jsonBytes)` and the json is `{"KEY": value}` (one or more keys).
  - *Read all keys of a domain*: `obtainInfo(domain, 1, in, out)` with `in = writeByteArray("{\"all\":0}")`. The `out` data is: `int len`, `int type`, then `len` bytes; the text is the first `len-1` bytes (trailing NUL), and it is a JSON object.
  - *Read one key*: same but `in` = `{"KEY":0}`; the text returned is the value of that key.
  - Domain ids: **1** radio, **2** settings (audio/display), **3** system state, **4** MCU hard-key info (radio seek-left/right commands are also sent here), **5** CAN info (MCU level), **6** customer info, **7** ATest, **8** offline config (`obtainInfo(8,0)` with `{"all":0}`), **4608** system key (cmd 4352 register key, 4353 clean key), **4864** touch.
- **Domain 2 (settings) keys `[CODE]`** (read and write by the same key): `SYS_VOL`, `SYS_MUTE`, `SYS_BEEP`, `SYS_BEEPVOL`, `SYS_BTVOL`, `SYS_TTSVOL`, `SYS_GPSVOL`, `SYS_TBOXVOL`, `defvol`, `carspeed_volume` (speed-dependent volume), `EQ40`, `EQ80`, `EQ500`, `EQ1k`, `EQ5k`, `EQ16k`, `bass`, `SYS_MID`, `treb`, `SYS_LOUD`, `audiofade`, `audiobal`, `3D_AUDIO_SW`, `SYS_AUDIOMODE`, `FM_LIMITER`, `AM_LIMITER`, `brightness`, `backlight`, `vicebacklight`, `setautobrighton`, `TFT1`, `TFT2`, `SYS_TIME12H`, `LANG_SEL`, `UNLOCK_STATE` (read-only door unlock state), `WELCOME_REQ`, `PRODUCT_INFO`, `CAN_COMPANY`, `SYS_FLAG`, `SYS_SYSFLAG2`, `SYS_ARMSAVE1..3`, `RRS_AUTO_LEVEL`, `RRS_RTURN_EN`, `RRS_AUTO_REQ`. The full list of proxy methods and domain/command numbers is in Appendix B.
- **Domain 3 (system) keys** `[CODE]`: `ACC_STATE`, `POWER_STATE`, `BACK_SIGNAL` (reverse), `ILL_STATE`, `SYSREADY`, `MCU_SOURCE` (read; write via `setMcuSource`), `MCU_STATE`, `BPOWER_ON`, `BRIGHT_TURNER`, `VICEDIRVER_HEADPHONE`, `NEED_SHOWDIALOG`, `MCU_TIME`, `SYS_TIME`. Several action methods exist (power key, reset key, beep, update state, mute 1 s, navi-voice notification, animation notification) sent as JSON to domain 3; see Appendix B.
- **Domain 1 (radio) `[CODE]`:**
  - Read all: `{"all":0}` -> JSON with `getfreq` (current frequency), `freq`, `scan`, `loc`, `st` (stereo), `stind`, `aps` (auto-preset search), `RADIO_AREA`, `RADIO_SREACH_STATE`, `RADIO_PLAYSTATE`, `AUX_PLAYSTATE`, signal level `signlevel`, `HAVESIG`, RDS keys `RADIO_NAME` (station name/PS), `RADIO_TEXT`, `PTY`, `TP`, `TP_INFO`, `TA_MODE`, `RDS_ON_OFF`, `RDS_TA_MODE`, `AF`, `EON`, `INTRO`, `LAGEL_FREG`.
  - Set frequency: `{"freq": (band << 14) | (freq & 16383)}`, band **`0` = FM, `3` = AM** (the factory rejects other values; corrected in revision 3, see Appendix N). FM values are in 10 kHz units (e.g. 9500 = 95.0 MHz, range 8750-10800, step 10), AM in kHz (range 522-1620, step 9).
  - Seek next/previous station: domain **4**, `{"RADIO_SREACH_R":0}` / `{"RADIO_SREACH_L":0}`. Stop scan: domain 1, `{"stop_scan":0}`. Scan: `{"scan":0}`. Play state: `{"RADIO_PLAYSTATE": n}`. AUX play state: `{"AUX_PLAYSTATE": n}`. Plus loc/stereo/APS toggles, RDS on/off, PTY, TA/AF clicks, factory radio area (Appendix B).
- Hard keys (domain 4) and system keys (domain 4608): the factory UI registers listeners to receive steering-wheel / panel key events (`McuHardKeyInfo`, `SystemKeyInfo` parcels). Exact parcel layouts: see decompiled `McuHardKeyInfo`/`SystemKeyInfo` (not needed unless implementing steering-wheel buttons).
- Status: MCU read-all in domains 1, 2 and 3, plus selected keyed reads, was **confirmed from a normal third-party app**. MCU settings writes, action commands, radio tuning/control, hard-key registration and key parcel decoding remain **`[UNTESTED]`**. SELinux is permissive, but the MCU service may still impose write-side restrictions.

### 3.4 Bluetooth, phone book, call state  [CODE] / [DEVICE] — internal API versus usable external access

**A. Apparent control service `zhbt_service` — source API exists, but is not available on this firmware as tested.**

- The source class `com.zhonghong.bluetooth.service.BtService` contains a Binder implementation with descriptor `com.zhonghong.bluetooth.aidl.IBtCtrlInterface`: `setCmd(int cmd, String value, String extra)`, `getValue(String key, String extra)`, `registerCallback(int domain, IBtDataCallback cb)`, and `unregisterCallback(int domain, IBtDataCallback cb)`.
- That class would register `zhbt_service` with `ServiceManager.addService(...)`, and the source `BtSDK.initData()` attempts to start it. However, **`BtService` is not declared in the supplied Bluetooth app manifest**. The manifest-declared `BtCtrlManagerService` returns `null` from `onBind()`.
- On the real unit, `ServiceManager.getService("zhbt_service")` returned `null` in the CarCheck snapshots. Do not implement against this Binder or describe its commands/getters as an available third-party API.
- For source archaeology only, the unregistered Binder class contains command constants for pairing/connect, A2DP/HFP, music transport, ID3, phone calls, contacts and call logs (see Appendix C). These are **not evidence that a normal launcher can invoke them**.
- The BT data callback class and domains (settings/music/phone/contact/call log) are similarly internal source definitions, not a live integration contract for this launcher.

**B. Content provider `content://com.zhonghong.bluetooth.provider.btinfo`** (authority `com.zhonghong.bluetooth.provider.btinfo`, exported, no permissions):
- `/btbase` -> columns `id, state, devname, power, signal, battery, talkname, talknum, micincar, micmute`
- `/btmusic` -> `id, title, artist, album, duration, btmusicstate`
- `/btcontacts` -> `id, name, num`
- `/ctrlbt` update channel (`enable_bt`).
  **Device result:** `btbase` and `btmusic` each returned one row, but useful metadata fields were null; `btcontacts` returned zero rows. These tables do not currently support a useful custom phone/BT-music UI.

**C. Content provider `content://com.car.phone_data`** (app `com.car.phoneprovider`, exported, no permissions):
- `/contacts` and `/contacts_favorite` -> `_id, address, name, number, pinyin, storage, type`
- `/call_log` -> `_id, active_start_time, address, end_time, name, number, start_time, timestamp, type` (type codes: 5 missed, 6 received, 7 dialed)
- `/force_contactes` and `/force_calllog` trigger a refresh.

**D. Cheap signals that need no binder:**
- System property `sys.btcall` = `"true"` while a BT call is active, `"false"` otherwise (set by the BT app).
- `Settings.System`: `bt_connected`, `key_bluetooth_state`, `key_signal_state`, `key_battery_state` (written by the factory status-bar SDK).
- `SystemStateInterface` (3.6): `getBluetoothConnectState()`, `getBluetoothInCallState()` and callbacks `notifyBTState`, `notifyBTPhoneState(int)`.
- Broadcast `com.zhonghong.bluetooth.call_last_number` is handled by an exported receiver in the BT app (`UpdateSystemReceiver`; the name suggests "call last number", behaviour not read in detail).

**E. Factory screens:** actions `android.bluetooth_btdial` (dialer), `android.bluetooth_btsettings` (BT settings), `android.bluetooth_btmusic` (BT music) on `com.zhonghong.bluetooth`.

**F. Active backend correction:** the source contains GOC, NForetek and IVT implementations, but `BtApp.onCreate()` calls `BtSDK.Config(1)`. `BlueToothManager.init(type=1)` selects `GocBluetoothAdapter`, and `ControllerFactroy.init(1)` selects `GocJavaController`. Therefore the active path in this firmware is **GOC**, not NForetek. NForetek classes in the APK are an alternative code path and must not be treated as the active backend. Full details and the GOC command/event map are in Appendix H.

### 3.5 Media: USB music, USB video, library, radio, AUX  [CODE]

**USB music service** — bind `com.zhonghong.yzmusic` / `com.zhonghong.music.model.service.UsbMusicService` (action `com.zhonghong.usb_music_action`, exported). Descriptor `com.zhonghong.mediaaidl.usbmusic.IUsbMusicAidlInterface` (standard AIDL):
1 `registerDataChange(IUsbMusicAidlListener)`, 2 `unregisterDataChange`, 3 `boolean isPlaying()`, 4 `String getTitle()`, 5 `String getAlbum()`, 6 `String getArtist()`, 7 `setMusicSource()` (switch the audio source to USB music), 8 `next()`, 9 `prev()`, 10 `playPause()`, 11 `play()`, 12 `pause()`.
Listener `com.zhonghong.mediaaidl.usbmusic.IUsbMusicAidlListener`: 1 `onId3(String title, String artist, String album)`, 2 `onPlayState(boolean playing)`.
There is no "play this track" call; choosing a specific file is done in the factory screen (`com.zhonghong.usb_music_list`).

**USB video service** — the current manifest declares `com.zhonghong.yzvideo.service.VideoService` (action `com.zhonghong.usb_video_action`), but its `onBind()` returns `null` in the supplied source. The older `com.zhonghong.video.model.service.VideoService` class has a Binder implementation but is not the active manifest component/current companion package. The probe bind request returned `true`, but `onServiceConnected` did not arrive within 5 seconds. Use the factory video Activity as a fallback. Video playback itself is supported by the factory app; **inline/PiP video inside the launcher and external transport control are not established**.

**Radio AIDL / BT-music AIDL** `[NOT FOUND]`: `IRadioAidlInterface` (`getFreq`, `isAMBand`, `isPlaying`, `setRadioSource`, `playPause`, `nextStation`, `prevStation`, `nextStep`, `prevStep`, `nextSearch`, `prevSearch`, `fMAMSwitch`) and `IBtMusicAidlInterface` (title/artist/album/play/pause/next/prev/`setBtMusicSource`) are defined in the music app, but the packages that would serve them (a radio service, `com.zhonghong.bluetooth.BtMusicService`) are not in the provided APKs. The launcher/logic code starts a service with action `com.zhonghong.radio.radioservice.action` (extra `command`), which does not exist in the provided APKs either. **Control the radio through MCU domain 1 (section 3.3).**

**Media library provider** `content://com.zhonghong.media` (exported, no permissions), tables:
`audio(_id, path, name, parent_path, title, album, artist)`, `id3(path, title, album, artist, name, parent_path, uuid, file_size)`, `video(_id, path, name, parent_path)`, `image(_id, path, name, parent_path)`, `txt(_id, path, name, parent_path)`, `status(path, state)`; URI patterns `audio`, `audio/*`, `video`, `video/*`, `image`, `image/*`, `txt`, `txt/*`, `id3`, `scan_state`, `scan_state/*`.

**AUX** — activity `com.zh.auxin` (VIEW). Source id 11 in Logic; MCU key `AUX_PLAYSTATE` (domain 1). `Settings.System system_state_aux`.

**Picture viewer** — `com.zhonghong.yzpicture` (also answers `com.zhonghong.usb_music_activity`).

---

### 3.6 System-state broker (`com.zhonghong.aidlserver`)  [CODE]

- Bind `com.zhonghong.aidlserver` / `com.zhonghong.aidlserver.service.SystemStateService` (action `com.zhonghong.aidlserver.service.SystemStateService`, exported, process `:systemstate`). A second service `SystemStateService2` serves the generic interface.
- `com.zhonghong.aidlib.state.SystemStateInterface`: 1 `registerCallBack(SystemStateCallBack)`, 2 `unregisterCallBack`, 3 `int getTuidNumber()`, 4 `boolean getNetworkState()`, 5 `boolean getBluetoothConnectState()`, 6 `boolean getBluetoothInCallState()`.
- `com.zhonghong.aidlib.state.SystemStateCallBack` (callback): 1 `notifyHeadlampState(boolean)`, 2 `notifyVOL(int)`, 3 `notifyBTPhoneState(int)`, 4 `notifyACC(boolean)`, 5 `notifyBTState(boolean)`, 6 `notifyNetworkState(boolean)`, 7 `notifyBackState(boolean)`, 8 `notifyPowerState(boolean)`.
- `SystemStateInterface2` (generic category/type store): `registerCallback(int, StateCallback)`, `registerServiceProvider(int, ServiceProvider)`, `getBooleanInfo/getIntInfo/getStringInfo(int,int)`, `setBooleanInfo/setIntInfo/setStringInfo(int,int,value)`, `notify*Info`. **Device result:** binding and descriptor retrieval succeeded; its generic getter/setter/provider methods were not exercised, so data availability remains `[UNTESTED]`. Known type ids (`ZServiceProviderTypes`): ACC 1001, back-car 1002, power 1003, volume 1004, mute 1005, headlamp 1006, main TFT backlight 1007 (second TFT 1008), illumination-on 1009, main TFT brightness 1010 (second 1011), brake warning 1012; Bluetooth: connect state 2001, phone state 2002, music state 2003, HFP 2004, A2DP 2005; network connect state 3001, TBOX UUID 3002; multiscreen 4001-4005 (vice screen state, screen lock, main/vice app name, headphone state). Categories: system 1000, Bluetooth 2000, network 3000, multiscreen 4000.
- Value for a quick implementation: use this broker's callbacks for ACC/back/headlamp/volume instead of polling. **Bluetooth caveat:** type `2005` is named as A2DP-connect state in `ZServiceProviderTypes`, but `BtCtrlManager` does not implement that type in `getBoolean()` (it implements only the coarse BT connect and phone-state types). Do not use a `false` response for type 2005 as proof A2DP is disconnected. `getBluetoothConnectState()` / `bt_connected` are coarse HFP/A2DP connection indicators, not an A2DP-only signal.

---

### 3.7 Other services / apps

| App | Component | What it offers |
|---|---|---|
| `com.zhonghong.update` | `UpdateService` (action `com.zhonghong.ctrl_update`, exported); also system service `zhupdate_service` (`com.zhonghong.update.aidl.IUpdateInterface`) | system update control. **Do not use** from a launcher |
| `com.zhonghong.screensaver` | `ScreenService` (action `com.zhonghong.screensaver.ScreenService`, exported) | start/stop the screensaver (started as a service; extras not analysed) |
| `com.zh.settings` | `SetService` (action `com.zhonghong.action.set`) + activities Sound/System/Wifi/Display/Field/EQ | system settings screens |
| `com.zhonghong.mcu` | `McuUpdateService`, `McuCtrlServer` | MCU firmware update only. **Do not use** |
| `com.zh.test` | `CmdService`, boot receiver | factory test tool, not exported |
| `com.zhonghong.mediaconfigtool`, `com.zhonghong.uuidtool` | USB receivers | factory tools |

---

### 3.8 Intents and broadcasts

**Activities (use `startActivity(new Intent(action))` or explicit component):**

| Action / component | Opens |
|---|---|
| `com.zhonghong.intent.action.music`, `com.zhonghong.usb_music_activity` | USB music player |
| `com.zhonghong.usb_music_list` | USB music track list |
| `com.zhonghong.video_activity` | USB video |
| `com.zh.yzradio/.MainActivity` (VIEW) | Radio |
| `android.bluetooth_btdial` / `android.bluetooth_btsettings` / `android.bluetooth_btmusic` | BT dialer / BT settings / BT music |
| `com.zhonghong.action.set` | system settings; `com.zhonghong.action.eq` = equalizer |
| `com.zhonghong.carsetting/.MainActivity` | car settings (TPMS etc.) |
| `com.zh.auxin/.MainActivity` | AUX-in |
| `com.zhonghong.launcher.MEDIA_ACTION`, `com.zhonghong.launcher.NAVI_ACTION` | factory launcher media / navigation pages |
| `com.zhonghong.update/.MainActivity`, `com.zh.test/.MainActivity`, `com.zhonghong.logic/.MainActivity` | update / factory test / logic status |
| `com.estrongs.android.pop`, `com.xbrowser.play`, `com.chartcross.gpstest`, `com.android.settings` | file manager (also the way to install APKs), browser, GPS test, Android settings |

**Broadcasts the Logic app listens for (any app can send them)** `[CODE]`:
- `com.zhonghong.logic.close_screen` -> turns the display (TFT) off.
- `com.zhonghong.android.key` with int extra `data = 4608` -> system beep.
- `action.radio.RDS_TRAFFIC` -> wakes/opens the screen for RDS traffic announcements.
- It also reacts to `android.media.VOLUME_CHANGED_ACTION` and master-mute changes.
Other broadcast/action names seen in the code (for completeness): `com.zhonghong.zuiserver.BROADCAST`, `com.zhonghong.LaunchAction`, `zhonghong.intent.action.START_UPDATE` / `END_UPDATE`, `com.polstar.navi.COORDINATE`, and the BT app's `com.zhonghong.bluetooth.call_last_number`. Packages referenced by the factory launcher but not installed on this unit: `com.zhonghong.avm` (surround camera), `com.zhonghong.carlife`, `com.zhonghong.power`, `com.zhonghong.phonelink`, `com.zhonghong.ledscreen`, `com.zhonghong.expandapps`.

---

### 3.9 Settings.System keys and system properties (readable by any app)

`Settings.System` (read; written by factory apps): `back_state` (`"true"` while reversing), `screen_brightness`, `screen_brightness_mode`, `navi_mix_value` (navigation-mix ducking value, default 10), `radio_rds_enbale`, `system_state_aux`, `bt_connected`, `key_bluetooth_state`, `key_signal_state`, `key_battery_state`, `key_type_car_level`, `time_12_24`, and the maintenance-reminder keys `CAR_ENGINE_OIL_CHANGE_TYPE`/`_REMAIN_TYPE`, `CAR_ENGINE_OIR_FILTER_CHANGE_TYPE`/`_REMAIN_TYPE`, `CAR_ENGINE_AIR_FILTER_CHANGE_TYPE`/`_REMAIN_TYPE`, `CAR_FUEL_FILTER_CHANGE_TYPE`/`_REMAIN_TYPE`. `Global`: `auto_time`, `auto_time_zone`, `auto_time_gps`.

System properties of interest: `sys.btcall` (BT call active), `sys.carlifevr`, `sys.stream.duckvalue` (duck level for streams), `zh.navi.pidlist`, `persist.sys.default.launcher`, `persist.sys.default_navi`, `persist.sys.default_voice_call`, `persist.sys.max_*`, `persist.phone.easyconnect`, `CarSettingKey` (= `0` on this unit), `ro.mcu.baudRate`, `ro.kernel.android.{gps,mcu,bt}`.
Read a property with `Class.forName("android.os.SystemProperties").getMethod("get", String.class, String.class)`.

## 4. Other usable features found in the apps (beyond the obvious)

Each line: feature — where it comes from — how to use it.

**Vehicle data (read-only, via CAN service, section 3.1)**
- Vehicle speed from CAN (frame 1218) — the read path worked, but the test stayed at 0 throughout; speed units and moving-vehicle behaviour remain `[UNTESTED]`.
- Gear / shifter lever signals and transmission warnings (frame 1218): transmission warning lamp, OBD warning flag, clutch/transmission temperature warnings, winter mode, overall ratio.
- Two odometers (BCM 800 and ICM 1219).
- Full lamp/indicator state (frame 963 has per-lamp status incl. daylight, roof lamp, brake lamp, reversing lamp, corner lamps; frame 564 has the switch states, hazard).
- Wiper and window signals exist in the factory decoder, but the owner’s physical tests and the CarCheck run did not establish usable transitions; **do not add wiper/window controls or indicators to the launcher** unless new device evidence appears. Central-lock action pulses, remote lock/unlock signals, anti-theft state, key battery, PEPS/keyless status, steering lock status and key position remain raw/partly understood; do not turn them into user-facing features without separate calibration.
- Frame 722 exposes airbag-related raw fields, but ECU/crash/cut-off diagnostic meanings were not validated. The factory Car Settings UI has a passenger-airbag on/off setting/status; **retain access to that factory setting** rather than deriving a warning from unverified raw CAN bits.
- TPMS per wheel: pressure, temperature, status, leak, sensor error, sensor battery.
- Ambient temperature.
- Service-reminder values written to `Settings.System` (oil, oil filter, air filter, fuel filter): readable without binder.

**System / power / screen**
- ACC, power, illumination (headlight switch), reverse, AVM, "running" states with callbacks (Logic or SystemState broker) — use for automatic day/night, auto-wake and parking behaviour.
- Screen off on demand: broadcast `com.zhonghong.logic.close_screen`.
- System beep: broadcast `com.zhonghong.android.key` with `data=4608`.
- Brightness / backlight / TFT on-off / auto-brightness via MCU domain 2 (`brightness`, `backlight`, `TFT1`, `setautobrighton`) or `Settings.System screen_brightness`.
- Volume, mute, EQ (this unit exposes bass/mid/treble only, not six bands), bass/mid/treble, loudness, balance/fade, 3D audio, beep volume, navigation/TTS/GPS/BT/TBOX volumes, speed-dependent volume (`carspeed_volume`) via MCU domain 2. Reading `SYS_VOL` and `SYS_MUTE` also tells the current level.
- Custom audio streams: `STREAM_NAVI = 10`, per-stream maximum 30 (`persist.sys.max_*`).
- Audio source arbitration (Logic): query who has focus, request/release a source id.

**Media / radio / phone**
- Radio: tune, seek, scan, stop, area, RDS (station name, radio text, PTY, TP/TA/AF/EON), stereo/loc/APS flags, signal level (MCU domain 1/4).
- USB music: now playing + controls (service), full library (provider), launch the factory list.
- USB video: factory video Activity is available; external AIDL/PiP control is not established.
- Pictures viewer, AUX-in.
- Bluetooth: the factory stack internally supports connection/device/signal/battery, GOC A2DP music metadata, playback/transport commands, phone calls, contacts and call logs. However, the standard external `zhbt_service` is absent and the exported `btinfo`/phone providers returned no useful data in the probe. The EasyConnected A2DP-acquire → Logic media-key route is a promising path for steering-wheel music buttons, but needs an on-device test. Custom launcher metadata, artwork, touchscreen BT transport and phonebook/call-log UI are **not yet accessible** (Appendix H).
- Phone mirroring (`net.easyconn`, `persist.phone.easyconnect=true`) and CarLife (`ID_CARLIFE=12` source id; the CarLife app itself is not installed).

**Utilities already installed on the unit**
- ES File Explorer, X Browser, GPS Test, Android Settings, package installer — launchable only from a custom launcher; they are the unit's route to files, web and APK installation.
- Navigation apps: Target (`polnav6`), Neshan, Google Maps; `Settings.System navi_mix_value` = how loud music stays under navigation voice; `zh.navi.pidlist` = pids of navigation processes.
- Factory screens for car settings, EQ, system settings, update, factory test (`com.zh.test`, `com.zhonghong.uuidtool`).

**Hard keys / steering wheel**
- Logic recognises a media-key set including `85`, `86`, `87`, `88`, `126`, `127` (plus other system keys). If the active source has audio focus, `SourceHelper.handleMediaKey()` broadcasts `onMediaButtonPressed` to registered source callbacks with the current Logic source ID. The BT music helper uses source ID `3` and maps `85`=toggle, `86`=stop, `87`=next, `88`=previous, `126`=play, `127`=pause. The EasyConnected acquire path can select source 3 and register the callback. This is `[CODE]` only so far; physical steering-button behavior still needs a stationary-car test. Steering-wheel learning exists (`setWheelKeyStudy`, MCU domain 2) `[UNTESTED]`.
- Do **not** assume Android broadcasts/standard `MediaSession` events are generated for the steering buttons. The verified source route is the proprietary Logic callback described above; test before relying on Android `KEYCODE_MEDIA_*` in the launcher.

## 5. Verification status and open gaps (consolidated 2026-10-30; read before building)

**Verified by factory-code analysis (`[CODE]`):** AIDL descriptors and transaction numbers; CAN frame IDs, bit maps and factory decoder formulas; Logic keys/events/source IDs; MCU domains, JSON conventions and proxy methods; Bluetooth command constants; provider schemas/URIs; available factory activity actions and documented system-property/`Settings.System` keys. Code-derived formats are not the same as proven third-party runtime access.

**Confirmed from the real unit by `carcheck_20261027_224456.txt` (`[DEVICE]`):**
- Normal third-party app can bind `com.zhonghong.can/.CanService`, read CAN data, register its callback, and observe live `CAN-CHG` events (initial snapshot: 115 decoded signals).
- `_logic_service` getter calls and callback registration work; illumination and reverse-state events were observed.
- MCU `zhonghong.mcu` domain read-all works for domains 1, 2 and 3; selected keyed reads work. This is read access only, not proof that writes/actions work.
- `SystemStateService` binds, getter calls and callback registration work; volume, reverse and Bluetooth phone-state events were observed. `SystemStateService2` was only bound, not functionally exercised.
- CAN field meanings newly corroborated by physical actions include four side-door open/closed polarity, tested lamp-switch/output polarity, brake pedal, handbrake, driver belt, and a strongly supported shifter map (P=9, R=10, N=11, D=12; see Appendix G for details).
- USB music service binds and its data-change listener registers; media-library `audio` and `id3` providers each return 10 rows. A `TYPE_PHONE` overlay was successfully added.
- Bluetooth connection/call state can be observed via broker callbacks and `sys.btcall`; `sys.btcall` was true during the call and false after it ended.

**Still untested, unavailable or only partial:**
1. Vehicle speed while moving and its displayed unit; `KeyPositionStatus`; raw airbag/crash/cutoff meanings; trunk/bonnet and auxiliary switch meanings. The usable odometer value is now decoded in Appendix I, but must be sanity-checked against the cluster. Passenger belt, wiper and window signals are not part of the agreed launcher UI.
2. MCU writes (`sendInfo`), volume/brightness/EQ mutation, radio tuning/control, hard-key registration and key-event parcel decoding. Some keyed reads (`brightness`, `EQ1k`, `getfreq`) failed; do not infer all MCU keys work merely because domain read-all succeeds.
3. External Bluetooth control through `zhbt_service`: the lookup was null and the declared `BtCtrlManagerService` returns no Binder. `BtService` exists in source but is not declared in the BT manifest; direct calls/metadata from a normal app are not available through that route.
4. Bluetooth `btinfo` provider useful fields are null; `btcontacts` is empty. Phone provider contacts/call-log queries returned null cursors. The GOC stack internally parses ID3, but the app has no working external API for the launcher.
5. EasyConnected steering-key route: statically traced but **not physically tested**. A2DP-only state, callback lifecycle when source 3 is already active, release/disconnect handling, and the actual media-key event codes from this steering wheel still require a controlled test. `net.easyconn.apk` is missing from the current repository.
6. Launcher touchscreen Bluetooth play/pause/next/previous, title/artist/album display and album artwork remain unresolved; `BaseId3Info` has no artwork field.
7. USB music transport commands were not invoked; the probe logged only the length (not content) of returned title/artist. Video AIDL is not usable in the current service source (`onBind()` returns null); use the factory video Activity. Beep-broadcast audible effect and `SystemStateService2` generic provider methods are untested.
8. No server found for `IRadioAidlInterface`, `IBtMusicAidlInterface`, `KeyInterface`, `ScreenInterface`, `NaviInterface`, or `ExtraDeviceInterface`; no CAN command sender class; `zh_can_service` was not registered (direct CAN service binding works); AVM/CarLife/power/phonelink packages referenced by the factory launcher are absent.

**Known pitfalls**
- `targetSdkVersion 22` is deliberate so permissions (location, storage, system alert window, boot completed) are granted at install on a unit with no permission UI.
- The unit has 32-bit ABIs only; do not ship 64-bit-only native code.
- A foreground-less background process can be killed; the factory apps run as system uid and are not.
- Writing to the USB root is not allowed for a normal app; use `/storage/udiskN/Android/data/<pkg>/files`.
- Do not read raw serial ports, do not call the update or MCU-update services.
- The factory Logic/BT apps already provide their own call UI and reverse overlay; a custom incoming-call overlay may duplicate them. The call-state broker is not a full call-control API. Never cover the reverse-camera view.
- Do not open `/dev/goc_serial` or `/dev/ttyAMA*` from the launcher. The persistent factory Bluetooth process owns GOC serial I/O; concurrent reads/writes can break the built-in BT stack.

## Appendix A — Complete CAN signal map (auto-extracted from the factory decoder)

Format: `Signal  byte N  bit B  len L` — `N` is the data-byte index (add 3 for the array index), `B` the start bit inside the byte, `L` the bit length, little-endian across bytes. Frames: CarStatus = 564 and 577, CarSet = 963, 800, 722, 1219, 1218, TPMS = 1042 and 1043, AmbientTemp = 695. Semantics that are confirmed are listed in section 3.1; everything else is the raw signal name from the factory decoder.

## Appendix D — Every AIDL interface found (descriptor, transaction code, method)

Codes are the generated `TRANSACTION_*` numbers (first-declared = 1). `?` = code not parsed (see the descriptor section above for IMcuService).

Bluetooth backend source audit: the active `BtApp` configuration selects GOC (`BtSDK.Config(1)` → `GocBluetoothAdapter` / `GocJavaController`). The APK also contains 31 NForetek AIDL interfaces (`com.nforetek.bt.aidl.*`, e.g. `UiCommand` and callbacks), but they belong to an alternative, unselected backend in this startup path. Do not build the integration around NForetek unless a different firmware/configuration is demonstrated. See Appendix H.

## Appendix G — Detailed device-probe verification (27 October 2026)

### G.1 Executive result

The probe conclusively demonstrates that an ordinary app can bind to the CAN service, read the decoded signal collection, register a CAN callback, and observe changes while physical controls are operated. It also demonstrates working read access to `_logic_service` and the MCU service, successful registration of the Logic callback and the System State Broker callback, and functioning USB-music/content-library access.

This resolves the original handoff's broad concern that these services might be unreachable from a third-party launcher. It does **not** prove every command is usable: MCU writes were not tested; direct Bluetooth control remains unavailable in this run; the Video service did not connect; and some vehicle signal meanings still require a targeted test.

### G.2 CAN service and tested signal meanings

#### G.2.1 Service access — CONFIRMED

- `bindService` to `com.zhonghong.can/.CanService` returned `true`.
- The remote descriptor was `com.zhonghong.cancommon.ICanInterface`.
- `registerCallback` succeeded.
- `getElementDataInfo` returned data for modules 1–4; the initial decoded snapshot contained 115 signals.
- The log contains live `CAN-CHG` changes after physical actions, demonstrating both readable data and working notifications from this normal app.
- `zh_can_service` remained unregistered, but this is not a blocker: binding directly to `com.zhonghong.can/.CanService` worked.

#### G.2.2 Signals now confirmed on this car

| Signal / area | Observed evidence | Usable interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Four side doors, frame 564 | For each of driver, front passenger, rear left and rear right, the field changed `1 -> 0` when opened and `0 -> 1` when closed. | `0 = open`, `1 = closed` for these door fields. Trunk and bonnet were not separately exercised in this run. |
| Position lamps, frame 564/963 | Position switch changed `0 -> 1` when turned on and back to `0` when lights were turned off; output status also changed. | `1` means the switch/input is active; use frame 963 lamp output for actual output state. |
| Low beam, frame 564/963 | Low-beam switch `0 -> 1` and output `0 -> 1`; both returned to `0` when switching to high beam / lights off. | `1 = active/on` for the switch bit; output status is the stronger indication of which lamp is currently on. |
| High beam, frame 564/963 | High-beam switch `0 -> 1`, output `0 -> 1`; both returned to `0` at lights-off. | `1 = active/on`. |
| Front and rear fog lamps, frame 564/963 | The corresponding output changed `0 -> 1`; the corresponding switch bit briefly changed `0 -> 1 -> 0`. | Output status confirms the lamp state. Switch bit behaves like a momentary/pulsed input in this test; do not assume it stays high while the lamp is on. |
| Turn indicators, frame 564/963 | Left/right input signals and lamp outputs toggled during the explicitly marked left/right indicator actions; `Indicator_Lamps_Command` showed `2` for left and `1` for right. | Indicator input/output is dynamic and flashes; don't interpret one instantaneous `0` as proof that the indicator was not selected. |
| Central lock/unlock | The marked lock/unlock actions produced short-lived changes in `Door_Lock_Output__Status`, `Master_Lock_Switch_Status` and the driver-door actuator signal; values returned to baseline quickly. | **Action response confirmed, persistent lock state not confirmed.** Treat these as pulses until a reliable stable locked/unlocked signal is isolated. |
| Hazard lights, frame 564/963 | Both left/right lamp outputs flashed together; `Hazard_LED_Output_Status` changed with the hazard action. `Hazard_Switch_Status` pulsed `0 -> 1 -> 0`. | Confirmed functional detection. Treat the switch as a pulse, not a durable on/off state. |
| Brake pedal, frames 564/577/963 | Pressing changed the pedal signals `0 -> 1` and brake-lamp output `0 -> 1`; releasing changed them back. | `1 = pressed`; `0 = released`. |
| Handbrake, frame 564 | During the marked handbrake-off action, `Hand_Brake_Switch_Status` changed `1 -> 0`; on action changed `0 -> 1`. | `1 = engaged`; `0 = released`, independently confirmed by the test. |
| Driver seat belt, frames 564/722 | At `DRIVER_BELT_FASTENED`, direct switch and frame-722 lock-recognition changed `1 -> 0`; at `DRIVER_BELT_UNFASTENED`, both changed `0 -> 1`. | For the tested driver-belt signals: `0 = fastened/locked`, `1 = unfastened/unlocked`. |
| Gear selector, frame 1218 | Stable values seen at the marked Neutral and Drive positions were `11` and `12`. During transitions the sequence was `9 -> 10 -> 11` (P toward N) and `12 -> 11 -> 10 -> 9` (D back toward P). Reverse lamp and `onBackStateChanged=true` occurred around value `10`. | Strongly supported mapping for this unit: `9 = P`, `10 = R`, `11 = N`, `12 = D`. Value `10` is supported by reverse lamp/back-state correlation, though there was no standalone `MARK GEAR_REVERSE` checkpoint. |
| Reverse state | Moving through reverse caused Logic `onBackStateChanged=true/false`; System State Broker emitted `back = 1/0`; the sample's `back_state` followed the reverse interval. | Reverse observation from Logic/System State is confirmed. The factory system owns the camera switching and overlay; the launcher must not cover the camera view. |
| Exterior lights / Logic event | `onIllStateChanged=true` appeared as the position/low-beam lamps came on; `false` appeared at lights-off. | Confirms a usable illumination callback for day/night UI logic. |
| Volume notifications | System State Broker emitted volume values `10, 11, 12, 13, 14`; subsequent MCU domain-2 read-all reported `SYS_VOL=14`. | Physical volume changes are observable via the broker; MCU current volume can be read. This does not yet prove that a third-party app can write volume through MCU. |
| Ambient temperature | CAN frame 695 alternated between raw `110` and `112`. Using the documented factory formula, these correspond to `15°C` and `16°C`. | Data is accessible. The one-degree alternation in this recording should be treated as observed behaviour, not assumed sensor accuracy. |

#### G.2.3 Still unresolved or only partly tested

| Signal / area | What the log actually proves | Updated status / next evidence needed |
|---|---|---|
| Passenger seat belt, frames 564/722 | Initial direct switch value was `1` and passenger frame-722 recognition was `3`, but neither changed during the marked passenger-belt actions. | **Still no data: the passenger belt fields never changed in the whole 42-minute drive; treat as unavailable (owner: the car has no sensor).** Earlier note: repeat with the passenger seat occupied as required by the car's sensor logic; log fasten/unfasten and occupancy changes. Do not infer polarity from the driver's signal. |
| Vehicle speed, frame 1218 byte 5 | Every sample logged `speed@1218=0`, including while the selector was briefly in D; the vehicle did not register movement in this test. | **RESOLVED in Appendix O: km/h (verified by driving).** Earlier note: collect a log while the car is actually moving, with a passenger operating the probe, and compare with the instrument cluster. Do not test or operate the probe while driving. |
| Odometers, frames 800 and 1219 | CarCheck’s short field output printed `53342` for both because it reported only the low 16 bits. The raw frame bytes contain the full four-byte value `5E D0 15 02` in both frames. | **Unit RESOLVED in Appendix O: one raw count = 1 metre (verified against integrated speed).** Corrected in Appendix I: factory `CarSetInfo` combines the lower and upper 16-bit halves into `0x0215D05E` (34,984,030 raw units); the factory maintenance screen divides by 1000 and floors, yielding 34,984 km. This follows the factory parser and both matching frames; still compare with the instrument cluster as a physical sanity check. |
| `KeyPositionStatus` (frame 577) | It toggled between `0` and `1` during several door operations, sometimes around a close/open event, but the test did not isolate a key-position action. | **RESOLVED in Appendix O: it is a short PEPS key-detection pulse around ignition changes; ignore it.** Do not use it as ignition/key-present state in the launcher until a dedicated test isolates each button/ignition state. Use Logic/MCU ACC and power fields instead. |
| Passenger belt / airbag frame 722 | The driver-belt recognition bits were correlated with belt action. Crash-intensity, ECU-error and passenger-airbag-cutoff fields did not undergo a controlled state change; the live checksum/counter changed normally. | **PARTLY RESOLVED in Appendix O: the ECU-error and passenger cut-off flags both go to 1 for about 6 s after every ignition-on (prove-out) and are 0 otherwise.** Airbag-related semantics beyond that remain unverified. Do not display crash, airbag-health or passenger-airbag warnings based only on these raw values. The changing checksum and alive counter are not themselves faults. |
| Wipers | The `WIPER_ON` / `WIPER_OFF` markers produced no observable change in the logged wiper switch/output fields; frame snapshots differed only in the airbag checksum/counter. | **RESOLVED in Appendix O: not usable.** During the 42-minute drive the front wiper fields never changed; the rear-wiper output only moved during ignition cycling. Earlier note: repeat with a clearly visible/physical wiper action and check `Wiper_*_Switch_Status`, `Front_Wiper_Output_Status`, `Rear_Wiper_Output_Status` and `Wash_Output_Status`. |
| Driver window | `WINDOW_DRIVER_DOWN` / `WINDOW_DRIVER_UP` markers did not yield a change in the logged window fields or frame-564 snapshot; the owner reports window sensor data is not useful on this vehicle. | **Not usable for the agreed launcher.** Omit window widgets; no further test is planned unless a distinct physical sensor/output is identified.
| Trunk, bonnet, rear wiper, rear windows and other auxiliary signals | Not isolated by a clear action in this log. | **Trunk RESOLVED in Appendix O (0 = open, 1 = closed); bonnet never changed (not exercised); rear wiper unusable.** Remaining signals: see Appendix O. |

**Odometer correction:** the short CarCheck summary displayed only the low 16-bit part (`53342`), not the full odometer. Raw frames and the factory parser show a 32-bit value; see Appendix I. The earlier 53 km interpretation is wrong and must not be used.

### G.3 System services and callbacks

| Interface | Test result | Updated status |
|---|---|---|
| `_logic_service` / `ILogicInterface` | Descriptor matched; getter calls for ACC, power, reverse, illumination, running, AVM, AUX and source/focus returned values; callback registration succeeded; callbacks produced illumination and reverse events. | **Third-party read calls and callbacks confirmed.** `setCmd` writes/source changes were not tested. |
| `zhonghong.mcu` / `IMcuService` | `getTest()=100`; read-all for MCU domains 1 (radio), 2 (settings) and 3 (system) returned `ok=1`; keyed reads for `SYS_VOL`, `SYS_MUTE`, `ACC_STATE`, `BACK_SIGNAL`, `ILL_STATE`, and `MCU_SOURCE` succeeded. | **Third-party reads confirmed.** No MCU setting writes were performed. |
| MCU keyed reads that failed | Keyed domain-2 reads of `brightness` and `EQ1k` returned `ok=0`; keyed domain-1 `getfreq` returned `ok=0` while radio read-all said status `off`. Domain-1 read without the input parcel also failed. | Avoid relying on these keyed reads without further diagnosis. Prefer the successful domain read-all where appropriate; test one known-safe write/read-back at a time before implementing settings controls. |
| `SystemStateService` | Bind and callback registration succeeded; Bluetooth connection/in-call state getters returned values; callbacks reported volume changes, reverse-state changes and Bluetooth phone-state changes. | **Primary useful state/callback API confirmed.** |
| `SystemStateService2` | Binding succeeded and descriptor was read. The generic provider/store methods were not exercised. | **Binding only confirmed; provider calls remain untested.** |
| `zh_can_service` | Lookup returned `null`. | Not a blocker: bind to `com.zhonghong.can/.CanService`, which worked. |
| `zhbt_service` | Lookup returned `null` initially and again after the observed call while `Settings.System bt_connected=true`; the log did not query the service while the call was explicitly active. | **Direct BT control service still unavailable in this run**, even with the phone connected and call-state activity. |
| `sys.btcall` | Initially unset; it became `true` during a call and `false` after the call ended. | **Useful call-in-progress fallback confirmed** on this unit. |
| `Settings.System` Bluetooth keys | `bt_connected=true`, `key_bluetooth_state=2`; signal and battery keys returned values. | Readable and useful for connection/status UI, though exact enumerations should be documented before display. |

### G.4 Bluetooth, media, providers and factory activities

- **Bluetooth provider:** `btbase` and `btmusic` each returned one row, but most state/device/call/music metadata fields were `null`; `btcontacts` returned zero rows. The phone provider's `/contacts` and `/call_log` queries returned null cursors; `/contacts_favorite` returned zero rows. These results do not currently support a reliable custom contacts/call-log UI.
- **Bluetooth state/call monitoring:** although direct `zhbt_service` control was unavailable, the System State Broker emitted `btPhoneState` events; `sys.btcall` was `true` during the observed call and `false` after it ended. Use these only for state detection, not call-control commands.
- **USB music service:** binding, interface descriptor, `isPlaying`, and listener registration succeeded. `getTitle` and `getArtist` returned strings with lengths 62 and 15, but the probe logs only the lengths, not the actual text. Music control methods (`playPause`, `next`, `prev`, etc.) were not invoked, so control behaviour is not yet tested.
- **Media library provider:** `content://com.zhonghong.media/audio` and `/id3` each returned 10 rows. `/video`, `/image` and `/txt` returned zero rows in this scan; `/scan_state` returned one row with `state=2` (meaning not decoded in this test). The read path is confirmed; contents depend on current mounted/scanned media.
- **USB video service:** the bind request returned `true`, but `onServiceConnected` did not arrive within 5 seconds; source analysis shows the currently declared service `onBind()` returns `null`. Do not regard the AIDL control binder as usable. Factory video activity action resolution itself succeeded; this does not indicate video playback is broken.
- **MCU radio read:** domain-1 read-all succeeded but returned radio `status=off`, `HAVESIG=false`, and `RADIO_AREA=0`. `getfreq` keyed read failed. This proves only that the service can return its radio domain, not that tuning/control works from this app.
- **Factory screen intents:** the probe resolved the radio, car-settings, AUX, Android Settings, ES File Explorer, factory music/video, BT dial/settings/music, EQ, system settings, and factory launcher media/navigation actions. Resolution proves an activity can be found, not that every screen was actually launched during this test.
- **Overlay:** adding an Android `TYPE_PHONE` overlay succeeded on the test unit. The factory call/reverse UI can still conflict with custom overlays; avoid duplicating its call UI and never obscure the reverse-camera view.
- **Beep broadcast:** the probe marked that it sent `com.zhonghong.android.key` with `data=4608`, but the log does not record whether a beep was actually heard. Effect remains unconfirmed.

### G.5 Status-label changes applied in this verified copy

1. **Section 3.0, row 1:** CAN binding, reading and callback registration are now marked `[DEVICE]` confirmed from a normal third-party app; per-signal semantics remain classified separately in Section 3.1 and Appendix G.2.
2. **Section 3.0, rows 2–3:** `_logic_service` getters/callbacks and MCU domain read calls are marked confirmed; all MCU and Logic writes remain untested.
3. **Section 3.0, row 4 / Section 3.4:** the Bluetooth-control service is documented as returning `null` in the initial and after-call lookups. The probe did not query it while the call was explicitly active, and direct control remains unproven.
4. **Section 3.0, row 5 / Section 3.4:** provider schema queries succeeded, but useful Bluetooth metadata fields were null and `btcontacts` was empty in this run.
5. **Section 3.1 / Section 5:** lamp polarity for tested lamps, four side doors, driver-belt signals, brake pedal, handbrake and the gear map are classified as device-observed; unresolved meanings are listed in Appendix G.2.3. The launcher UI still explicitly omits every seat-belt widget per the owner’s product decision.
6. **Section 3.5:** the Video service binding attempt is recorded as unsuccessful at the connection stage: `bindService` returned `true`, but no `onServiceConnected` arrived within 5 seconds.
7. **Section 5:** serial-port purposes remain untested. Do not use those ports in the launcher; the verified Binder interfaces make direct UART access unnecessary.
8. **Section 3.6:** `SystemStateService` getter/callback usage is confirmed; `SystemStateService2` was only bound, not functionally tested.

### G.6 Launcher implementation guidance based on this run

- Build the vehicle-state layer around `CanService` callbacks and refresh reads; do not poll or read `/dev/ttyAMA*` ports.
- Use `_logic_service` / System State Broker events for ACC, power, reverse, illumination, volume and Bluetooth call/connection state. Keep `Settings.System back_state` as a reverse-state fallback if useful.
- Use the current tested gear values only with the above mapping: `9=P`, `10=R`, `11=N`, `12=D`. On reverse state, immediately let the factory camera flow remain visible; the launcher must not draw a full-screen or touch-blocking layer over it.
- Use frame-963 output states for current lamp statuses; some frame-564 switch fields pulse or toggle during operation.
- The launcher product scope explicitly **excludes the entire seat-belt section**, even though driver-belt bits changed in the probe. Do not show a seat-belt widget. Do not show wipers/windows. Passenger-airbag on/off must remain accessible through the factory Car Settings UI; do not infer airbag health from unverified raw CAN fields. Speed remains hidden/uncalibrated until logged while moving. Odometer uses Appendix I’s factory 32-bit decoder and should be cross-checked against the cluster.
- Use the MCU service for reads at first. Do not add write-based volume, brightness, EQ or radio controls until a deliberately selected, reversible write is tested and verified by reading the value back. Do not assume `brightness`, `EQ1k` or `getfreq` keyed reads work because those failed in this probe.
- USB music/library reads can support a first media card. Keep factory music activity as a fallback for track selection. For video, launch the factory screen rather than assuming the video AIDL control service is ready.
- For Bluetooth, retain factory dialer/settings/music entry points and a coarse connection/call-state indicator. Add steering-wheel BT music handling only after the parked-car test in Appendix H passes. Do not claim launcher song metadata, cover art, touchscreen BT transport, direct call commands, contacts or call logs until a real external API is found and validated.

### G.7 Short, prioritized next-test list

1. Compare the corrected 34,984 km parser-derived odometer with the actual instrument-cluster reading; then capture speed while the car is moving, with a passenger operating/logging the probe (never operate the probe while driving).
2. Perform a reversible MCU write test (start with volume or another low-risk setting), read it back, and restore the original value. Treat each setting as separately verified.
3. Run the EasyConnected acquire/steering-key test in Appendix H while parked and while A2DP audio is actively playing from the phone. Test both transitions into BT source 3 and the already-source-3 case, then test call/focus loss and reconnect.
4. Retest the factory video Activity with a USB video; do not assume the current VideoService Binder is usable.
5. Obtain and decompile `net.easyconn.apk`; it is not in the currently accessible 26-file GitHub repository. Do not spend further time trying `zhbt_service` unless new evidence shows a valid service registration.

## Appendix H — Bluetooth phone music / GOC stack / steering-wheel route (source analysis 30 October 2026)

This appendix supersedes the old statement that the active Bluetooth backend is NForetek. The current factory BT app contains multiple backends, but the active firmware configuration selects GOC.

### H.1 Active backend selection — `[CODE]`

Relevant source paths in the supplied `sources.zip`:

- `sources/com.zhonghong.bluetooth/sources/com/zhonghong/bluetooth/application/BtApp.java`
- `.../BtSDK.java`
- `.../BlueToothManager.java`
- `.../ControllerFactroy.java`
- `.../impl_goc_java/GocJavaController.java`
- `.../impl_goc_java/GocJavaDataTranfser.java`
- `.../audiofocus/BtMusicAudioHelper.java`
- `.../audiofocus/BaseSourceHelper.java`
- `.../manager/BtMusicCtrlManager.java`
- `.../receiver/EasyConnectedReceiver.java`

`BtApp.onCreate()` invokes `BtSDK.Config(1).supportMultiNumber(true).build()`. `BlueToothManager.init(type=1)` creates `GocBluetoothAdapter`; `ControllerFactroy.init(1)` creates `GocJavaController`. Type 0 selects NForetek and type 2 selects IVT, but neither is the active selection in this `BtApp` startup path.

The GOC controller opens `new SerialPort(new File(mSerialName), 115200, 0)`. `mSerialName` is `"/dev/" + SystemProperties.get("ro.kernel.android.bt", "goc_serial")`; on this unit the property is `goc_serial`, hence `/dev/goc_serial` at 115200 baud. The factory BT process owns this serial I/O. **Do not open, read or write this device from the launcher**; competing access can steal bytes or break the original stack.

### H.2 GOC music commands and responses — `[CODE]`, not yet runtime-tested independently

| Purpose | GOC command / indication | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Request current song metadata | `AT#MK` | `CMD_INQUIRY_MUSIC_INFO`; request only, does not start playback. |
| Play | `AT#MS` | `CMD_PLAY_MUSIC` |
| Pause | `AT#MJ` | `CMD_PAUSE_MUSIC` |
| Toggle play/pause | `AT#MA` | Declared as `CMD_PLAY_PAUSE_MUSIC`. |
| Next | `AT#MD` | `CMD_NEXT_SOUND` |
| Previous | `AT#ME` | `CMD_PREV_SOUND` |
| Stop | `AT#MC` | `CMD_STOP_MUSIC` |
| Mute / unmute music | `AT#VA` / `AT#VB` | Used by focus handling. |
| A2DP state | `MU` | Parser maps state to an A2DP connection state and reports whether the A2DP stream is active. |
| Music play/stop | `MB` / `MA` | Internal play state values: play indication maps to 0, stop indication maps to 2. |
| Song metadata | `MI` | Payload after prefix is split on `[FF]`; six fields are expected. |
| Track progress | `MP` | Parses four hex characters for position and four for duration. |

For `MI`, `GocJavaDataTranfser.processSongInfo()` expects six `[FF]`-separated fields and creates `BaseId3Info(album=infos[2], artist=infos[1], title=infos[0])`. The remaining fields include track/time/index/count metadata. `BaseId3Info` contains **album, artist and title only**; no cover-art field exists in this model. The parser and resulting `MusicManager` callbacks are inside the BT application process.

### H.3 Why the normal app cannot currently read BT metadata or call the controls — `[CODE]` + `[DEVICE]`

1. The BT manifest declares `BtCtrlManagerService` with action `com.zhonghong.bluetooth.START_BtCtrlService`, but this component's `onBind()` returns `null`.
2. The source class `com.zhonghong.bluetooth.service.BtService` contains the `IBtCtrlInterface` Binder and would register `zhbt_service`, but **`BtService` is not declared in the supplied BT manifest**. `BtSDK.initData()` attempts `startService(new Intent(context, BtService.class))` and catches/logs any exception. The real-device CarCheck did not find `zhbt_service` in ServiceManager.
3. The BT content provider `content://com.zhonghong.bluetooth.provider.btinfo/btmusic` exposes columns `title`, `artist`, `album`, `duration`, `btmusicstate`, but the probe returned null useful fields. The provider table is seeded with an empty row; source search did not find a functioning writer that publishes the GOC ID3 data into this provider. `btcontacts` was empty.
4. `com.car.phone_data` is exported in the phone-provider manifest, but the CarCheck's `/contacts` and `/call_log` queries returned null cursors. Manifest export alone is not proof of usable data.
5. `MyMediaButtonBroadcast` is not a reliable external route: it is not manifest-declared and no dependable dynamic registration was found.

Therefore: **internal BT capability is not equivalent to a public API for the launcher**. Do not build a custom BT track card, artwork, direct touchscreen transport or call-control UI against `zhbt_service` or the empty providers yet. Android `MediaSession`/`MediaBrowser` publication is not established by this source analysis.

### H.4 Steering-wheel transport route — promising `[CODE]`; real-car test pending

The strongest path found for the agreed Level-3 steering-wheel controls is the existing factory handshake with EasyConnected:

1. The BT manifest declares `EasyConnectedReceiver` with `android:exported="true"` and no permission, including action `net.easyconn.a2dp.acquire` (also lists `net.easyconn.a2dp.release`, `net.easyconn.bt.checkstatus`, `net.easyconn.bt.connected`, `net.easyconn.app.quit`, `net.easyconn.bt.connect`, `net.easyconn.connection.break`).
2. In the receiver source, the only A2DP transition with a specific action branch is `net.easyconn.a2dp.acquire`, which calls `BtMusicAudioHelper.getInstance().doEasyLinkEnter()`.
3. `doEasyLinkEnter()` unmutes BT music, sets `isLinkState=true`, and, **only if `getCurSource()!=3`**, calls `setSource()` and `registerSourceCallback()`. BT music Logic source ID is `3`.
4. `Logic.SourceHelper.setSourceId(3)` maps this Logic source to MCU source `13`. Do not confuse Logic source IDs with the `MCU_SOURCE` values read from MCU domain 3; they are different namespaces.
5. `LogicBinder` recognises media key codes including `85`, `86`, `87`, `88`, `126`, `127`. `SourceHelper.handleMediaKey()` requires Logic audio focus, then broadcasts `onMediaButtonPressed` with both the key code and current source ID to registered Logic source callbacks.
6. The BT `BaseSourceHelper` registers a source callback for source ID 3. `BtMusicCtrlManager` maps the received key codes as follows:

| Key code | BT music operation |
|---:|---|
| 85 | Toggle play/pause based on internal playing state |
| 86 | Stop |
| 87 | Next track |
| 88 | Previous track |
| 126 | Play |
| 127 | Pause |

`BtApp.onCreate()` registers `BtMusicCtrlManager` and `BtMusicAudioHelper` during startup, and the application is marked persistent in the BT manifest. Thus the callback target exists without intentionally opening `MusicActivity`.

**Caveats to test:**
- If the current Logic source is already `3` when `a2dp.acquire` arrives, `doEasyLinkEnter()` skips both `setSource()` and `registerSourceCallback()`. The callback may therefore not be registered in that already-source-3 case.
- The manifest lists `net.easyconn.a2dp.release`, but `EasyConnectedReceiver.onReceive()` has no explicit handling branch for it. Callback unregister/source cleanup on A2DP release is not established by that receiver.
- `getBluetoothConnectState()` and `Settings.System bt_connected` are coarse HFP/A2DP indicators. `ZServiceProviderTypes` declares A2DP type `2005`, but `BtCtrlManager.getBoolean(2005)` returns the default false because only other Bluetooth types are implemented. Do not use it as an A2DP-only status.
- The route is **static source analysis only**. No physical steering-wheel key was confirmed in this test run.

### H.5 Safe parked-car verification procedure

Use a passenger/technician for ADB/log capture. Do not operate ADB or a probe while driving.

1. Park safely. Connect the phone to the car Bluetooth and start music on the phone so A2DP is actively streaming. Keep the custom launcher visible.
2. Record the current Logic source/focus state and current playback state.
3. Send the same acquire action that EasyConnected is expected to send:

```bash
adb shell am broadcast -a net.easyconn.a2dp.acquire -p com.zhonghong.bluetooth
```

4. With the car stationary and the launcher still visible, press steering-wheel play/pause, next and previous. Verify that the phone's current track/playback changes and that the launcher does not leave the foreground.
5. Repeat twice: (a) first while source 3 is not active, so acquire must select it and register callbacks; (b) again when source 3 is already active, to expose the callback-registration caveat.
6. Test audio-focus loss/gain and a phone call, then end the call. The BT helper's source code mutes/pauses on focus loss and unmutes/resumes after focus gain when it itself paused playback. Confirm no unexpected permanent mute or stuck source.
7. Test EasyConnected disconnect/release and reconnect. Confirm the source and callback are cleaned up; do not assume the release receiver currently handles it.
8. Record logcat for tags `BtMusicSourceHelper`, `BtMusicCtrlManager`, `LogicBinder`, `SourceHelper`, `BT_Controller` and `BT_Parse`.

Do not repeatedly send source-changing broadcasts in a production launcher until the above lifecycle test has been completed. The acquire broadcast does not itself request song metadata, start music, or provide track commands to the launcher; it asks the factory BT app to take/prepare its BT music source.

### H.6 What is still needed to complete Level 3

- Obtain and decompile **`net.easyconn.apk`**; it is installed on the head unit but missing from the currently accessible GitHub repository. Inspect its A2DP acquire/release logic, connection detection and media-key handling.
- Determine whether the GOC parser's ID3 callback can be bridged by a supported exported component, an officially available broker callback, or another public API. Do not use private reflection into the BT process or serial-port sharing as the production design.
- Prove a safe touchscreen transport interface for play/pause/next/previous. The receiver currently supports source acquisition, not a command interface from a third-party app.
- Confirm whether any Android MediaSession exists while GOC A2DP music plays; this remains untested.
- Album artwork is not in the current `BaseId3Info` payload. A separate metadata/artwork source would be needed even after title/artist/album are bridged.

## Appendix I — Corrected 32-bit odometer decode and maintenance reminder calculation (30 October 2026)

The earlier CarCheck summary printed `53342` for both BCM and ICM. That value is only the low 16-bit half; it is **not** the full odometer and must not be divided by 1000 to display 53 km.

### I.1 Raw frames recorded

```text
RAW 800:  03 20 09 5E D0 15 02 00 00 00 00 00 76 0A
RAW 1219: 04 C3 09 5E D0 15 02 07 00 00 00 00 21 0A
```

Both contain the same odometer payload bytes `5E D0 15 02`.

### I.2 Factory parser and result

`com.zhonghong.canproxy.bean.CarSetInfo` parses BCM and ICM independently with the same 32-bit combination:

```java
ODO = getIntByBit(bytes, 0, 0, 16)
    + ((getIntByBit(bytes, 2, 0, 16) << 16) & 4294967295L);
```

The resulting little-endian integer is `0x0215D05E` = **34,984,030 raw units**. Both frames match. `MaintainServiceNewFragment.getKmMiles()` converts this value using `floor(raw / 1000.0)`, so the factory display calculation is **34,984 km**.

This is a code-and-raw-frame decode, not an independent visual comparison with the instrument cluster. Do a stationary cluster comparison before treating the figure as physically cross-checked. Do not use the earlier 53 km interpretation.

### I.3 Current maintenance reminders from CarCheck

The tested `Settings.System` values for all four reminder records were:

```text
CAR_ENGINE_OIL_CHANGE_REMAIN_TYPE       = 4000_33926
CAR_ENGINE_OIR_FILTER_CHANGE_REMAIN_TYPE = 4000_33926
CAR_ENGINE_AIR_FILTER_CHANGE_REMAIN_TYPE = 4000_33926
CAR_FUEL_FILTER_CHANGE_REMAIN_TYPE       = 4000_33926
```

The factory parser splits each value as `targetInterval_previousServiceOdometer`. Its formula is:

```text
remaining = targetInterval - (currentOdometerKm - previousServiceOdometerKm)
```

Using target interval 4,000 km, previous service marker 33,926 km, and decoded current odometer 34,984 km:

```text
4000 - (34984 - 33926) = 2942 km remaining
```

Thus the current factory-calculated reminder is **2,942 km remaining** for oil, oil filter, air filter and fuel filter. This reflects the values currently stored in Settings.System; confirm the service records/intervals with the owner before presenting them as confirmed maintenance history. The factory UI's `updateODO_calculated_By_BCM()` only logs BCM; ICM value is used for maintenance calculations.

## Appendix J — Agreed launcher feature matrix and implementation priorities

This is the product/implementation handoff, not proof that every feature is already accessible. The status in the right column takes precedence over an optimistic feature name elsewhere in this older technical document.

| Priority | Feature | Decision / next action |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Native launcher shell | Build a normal third-party Kotlin launcher APK, 32-bit ARM compatible, Android 7.1.2/SDK 25. `targetSdkVersion 22` is preferred for the no-runtime-permission-UI environment. No root/system UID. |
| P0 | Screen/UI system | Arabic, 952×600 landscape. Multiple structurally different layouts (not colour-only themes); selectable colour themes as a separate layer; large controls and minimal driving clutter. |
| P0 | Reverse safety | On Logic/SystemState reverse callback, relinquish/avoid any full-screen overlay and let the factory reverse-camera flow appear. Never intercept the camera touch layer. |
| P0 | Doors/gear/lights/handbrake/brake | Use the verified CAN/Logic event paths and tested polarities. Use event callbacks and refresh reads; do not constantly poll. |
| P0 | Bluetooth Level 3 — steering keys | Implement only after Appendix H parked-car test passes. It should preserve launcher foreground while audio continues from the phone. Handle connection, source, focus and release lifecycle. |
| P1 | Odometer/maintenance | Use Appendix I's full 32-bit decode and factory km conversion; sanity-check odometer against instrument cluster. Present maintenance reminders only when their stored values are present and owner-confirmed. |
| P1 | TPMS / ambient temperature | Apply factory formulas and availability gating. Smooth minor ambient swings. Verify TPMS units and all wheel states on device. |
| P1 | Arabic voice alerts | Optional door-open alert using only validated door events; debounce/repeat suppression; setting to enable/disable. Arabic TTS availability must be checked on device. |
| P1 | Startup greeting | Optional greeting saying “مرحباً إسماعيل” or equivalent, with an explicit enable/disable setting; test voice output and avoid playing during calls/reverse alerts. |
| P1 | USB music | Build a media card around `UsbMusicService` and library provider, but test its controls before exposing active buttons. Provide factory-list fallback. |
| P1 | Navigation shortcuts/mix | Launch Neshan/Google Maps/Target. Read/test navigation mix settings. Never obscure reverse camera. |
| P1 | Passenger airbag | Preserve access to the factory passenger-airbag ON/OFF setting/status. Do not convert raw CAN cutoff/error fields into warnings until validated. |
| P2 | Phone contacts/call log/custom call overlay | Desired but blocked by current null/empty provider results and unavailable `zhbt_service`. Keep factory BT dialer UI as fallback. Revisit after new API evidence. |
| P2 | Bluetooth track metadata / artwork / touchscreen controls | Desired part of Level 3, but not solved. Need EasyConnected APK/API discovery or another supported external bridge. GOC internal ID3 is not enough. |
| P2 | Radio custom controls | Keep factory radio Activity until MCU writes/tuning are proven reversible and reliable. |
| P2 | Inline/PiP video | Not established; factory video Activity is the supported fallback at present. |
| Excluded | Seat-belt section | Do not implement or display a driver/passenger belt widget. This is an explicit product decision. |
| Excluded | Wiper/window widgets | Do not implement; no useful vehicle signals have been verified and the owner reports these sensors are unusable. |

### J.1 Implementation architecture guidance

- Separate modules/classes for `CanRepository`, `LogicStateRepository`, `McuReadRepository`, `SystemStateRepository`, `UsbMediaRepository`, `BluetoothIntegration`, navigation launchers and UI. Hardware callbacks should update a shared state model; UI must not call Binder synchronously on the main thread.
- Prefer callbacks + a controlled refresh/read after a CAN module notification. Unregister on service disconnect/activity shutdown. Add reconnect logic after Binder death.
- Keep reads separate from writes. MCU domain read-all and selected reads have been tested; writes and audio/radio mutations have not. Do not ship setting write controls until a reversible write/read-back/restore test passes for each key.
- Audio-source switching is controlled by Logic IDs. BT music is Logic source 3 and maps to MCU source 13; USB music is a different source. Never assume `MCU_SOURCE` equals the Logic source ID.
- Use System State/Logic notifications for ACC, reverse, illumination, volume and BT coarse state. Do not read serial ports directly.
- Avoid a custom incoming-call overlay until the factory UI behaviour and call callbacks are well understood. If the factory call screen appears, let it own call interaction.

## Appendix K — Repository and source-provenance audit (30 October 2026)

The public repository `https://github.com/IsmailAabedah/forDel` was accessed through the GitHub connection. Its `main` tree at the inspected revision contained **26 files, all APKs**, with a total reported size of approximately 49.1 MB. Relevant packages include `com.zhonghong.bluetooth`, `com.zhonghong.logic`, `com.zhonghong.mcu`, `com.zhonghong.aidlserver`, `com.zhonghong.yzmusic`, `com.zhonghong.yzvideo`, `com.zhonghong.can`, `com.zhonghong.carsetting`, `com.zhonghong.launcher` and `com.car.phoneprovider`.

**Missing from that repository:** `net.easyconn.apk`, `framework.jar`, `services.jar`, and `framework-res.apk`. `net.easyconn` is listed as installed on the head unit, but its source was not present in `sources.zip` and its APK is the next most valuable file for this work.

The GitHub connector exposed the tree and smaller APKs, but did not return the full binary payload of the 4.89 MB `com.zhonghong.bluetooth.apk`; the detailed Java analysis of the BT code in Appendix H is therefore based on the previously supplied and extracted `sources.zip` plus `all_manifests.zip`, not a claim that the large GitHub binary was independently downloaded and re-decompiled in this session. The repository audit is a file inventory, not an assertion that all 26 APKs were decompiled and read class-by-class. The deepest code review to date focuses on Bluetooth, Logic, MCU, CAN, AIDL broker, media, video and phone-provider paths.

### K.1 Next files to obtain

1. `net.easyconn.apk` — highest priority, specifically to inspect A2DP acquire/release and media-key broadcast behaviour.
2. `framework.jar`, `services.jar`, `framework-res.apk` — useful only if later work requires framework-level media-key, MediaSession or hidden service verification.
3. If more runtime evidence is needed: a parked-car CarCheck log during active phone A2DP playback with steering-wheel play/pause/next/previous pressed, including logcat tags listed in Appendix H.5. Do not collect/operate logs while driving.


---

## Appendix L — EasyConnected (`net.easyconn`) integration analysis (31 October 2026)

Source: the jadx output of `net.easyconn.apk` supplied by the owner (2,890 Java files plus the decoded manifest). Everything here is `[CODE]`; nothing was exercised on the unit.

### L.1 What it is and what it is not
EasyConnected is the phone-mirroring app (Android/iOS link; the factory launcher and Logic treat it as the "EasyLink/CarLife" app: `net.easyconn/net.easyconn.ui.Xzc01MainActivity`). Its whole protocol with a head unit is **plain broadcasts**. A search of its sources finds **no reference to any ZhongHong interface** (`com.zhonghong`, `android.zhonghong`, `com.logic`, MCU, CAN, `zhbt_service`). It therefore gives **no extra access** to the MCU, CAN, Logic or Bluetooth control, and it does **not** solve the missing `zhbt_service`. What it adds is (a) a documented broadcast protocol a launcher can speak, (b) phone-link state and media/navigation information while a phone is linked, and (c) the A2DP hand-off that the Bluetooth app already answers.

### L.2 Manifest surface (exported / reachable by other apps)
| Component | Exposure | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `EcShortcutBroadcastReceiver` | exported, action `net.easyconn.start.ec`, int extra `ec_app_type` | start EasyConnected and open a page (L.3) |
| `EcConnectStateReceiver` | exported, actions `net.easyconn.connect.checkstatus` and `net.easyconn.link.checkstatus` | state query. Replies are broadcasts: `net.easyconn.mirror.in` / `net.easyconn.mirror.out` and `net.easyconn.link.in` / `net.easyconn.link.out` |
| `EasyConnectProxyService` | exported, action `net.easyconn.proxy.service`, **Messenger** based | registration / licence / QR / UUID helper. **Do not use**: it handles identifiers and licensing, not control |
| `MediaRenderService` | exported, action `com.carbit.ios` | iOS (AirPlay-style) renderer. Not a control surface |
| `NetLinkService`, `UsbIntentReceiver`, others | internal | VPN link and USB attach handling |
| Activities | `net.easyconn.ui.Xzc01MainActivity`, action `net.easyconn6.mainactivity` | launch targets |

### L.3 Pages for `net.easyconn.start.ec` (int extra `ec_app_type`)
1 navigation, 2 music, 3 voice assistant (VR), 4 talkie, 5 navigation-home, 6 navigation-work, 7 main, 8 gas stations, 9 car parks, 10 4S shop, 11 music-XMLY, 12 music-QQ, 13 music-radio, 14 music-native, 15 WeChat, 16 personal centre, 17 app manager, 18 add/OTA, 19 WeChat messages.

### L.4 Broadcast catalogue
**Inbound (what EasyConnected listens for; a head unit sends these):**
- `net.easyconn.BACKING_UP_START` / `net.easyconn.BACKING_UP_STOP` (reverse gear)
- `net.easyconn.navi.daytime` / `net.easyconn.navi.night` (day/night)
- `net.easyconn.drivemode.opened` / `net.easyconn.drivemode.closed`
- `net.easyconn.bt.connected` (String[] extra `name`: connected Bluetooth device names), `net.easyconn.bt.opened`, `net.easyconn.bt.closed`
- `net.easyconn.start.vr` / `net.easyconn.stop.vr`, `net.easyconn.navigation.STOP_EASYCONN_NAVI`, `net.easyconn.mediacodec.acquire` / `release`
- `net.easyconn.KEYCODE` with int extras `ECBtnCode` and `ECBtnEventType` (key forwarding to the phone app)
- `android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON` (KeyEvent 85 play/pause, 87 next, 88 previous, 126 play, 127 pause) — acted on only while EasyConnected's own music audio is active
**Outbound (what EasyConnected sends; a launcher can listen):**
- `net.easyconn.a2dp.acquire` and `net.easyconn.a2dp.release` (to the Bluetooth app), `net.easyconn.bt.checkstatus`, `net.easyconn.bluetooth.call`, `net.easyconn.bt.setting`
- `net.easyconn.music.status` with Bundle extra `ec_music_info`: `status` (int), `title`, `artist`, `album`, `albumArtist`, `length` (long). **Only for music played inside the linked phone app, not for generic A2DP**; no artwork field
- `net.easyconn.audiofocus.music.status` (int `status`)
- `net.easyconn.navigation.status` (navigation HUD of the linked phone: `cameraSpeed`, `cameraDistance`, `naviIcon`, `nextRoad`, `roadRemainingDistance`, `roadRemainingTime`, `destinationRemainingDistance`, `destinationRemainingTime`, `arriveTime`, `arriveTimeZone`, car direction), `net.easyconn.navigation.STARTED` / `STOPPED`
- link state: `net.easyconn.link.in/out`, `net.easyconn.mirror.in/out/pause/resume`, `net.easyconn.app.open.state`, `net.easyconn.app.open/pause/resume/quit`
- phone data: `net.easyconn.weather.info`, `net.easyconn.gps`, `net.easyconn.phone.time`, `net.easyconn.vr.status`, `net.easyconn.vr.text`, `net.easyconn.vr.tips`, `net.easyconn.carcontrol.request/cmd/response`
**Button codes** (`ECBtnCode`): music play 4160, next 4161, previous 4162, pause 4163, stop 4164, play/pause 4167; volume up 4176, down 4177; corner buttons 4192-4195; mode 4208; app front 4224; app back 4240; force landscape 4256, cancel landscape 4257, toggle landscape 4258; talkie group mute 4113, cancel mute 4114, toggle mute 4115. **Event types** (`ECBtnEventType`): 0 up, 1 down, 2 click, 3 double-click, 4 long-press.

### L.5 Factory side of the handshake `[CODE]`
The factory Bluetooth app contains the receiver for `net.easyconn.a2dp.acquire` and `net.easyconn.bt.checkstatus`. It answers with `net.easyconn.a2dp.acquire.ok` / `.fail`, `net.easyconn.a2dp.release.ok` / `.fail`, and `net.easyconn.bt.connected` / `.opened` / `.closed`. The factory launcher and Logic only **launch** EasyConnected and treat its package as the CarLife/EasyLink source; **no factory app sends** `BACKING_UP_*`, `navi.*`, `drivemode.*` or `net.easyconn.KEYCODE` to it. On this unit EasyConnected therefore does not hear about reverse or day/night unless something else sends it; a launcher may send them `[UNTESTED]`.

### L.6 Consequences for the launcher
1. **Level-3 steering-wheel control of Bluetooth music** stays exactly as Appendix H describes (A2DP hand-off). EasyConnected provides **no AVRCP track-metadata API** for plain Bluetooth. Track metadata exists only through `net.easyconn.music.status` while the EasyConnected phone app is linked. Otherwise show only the connected device and play state.
2. Phone-link state (phone linked / mirroring) is readable through the check-status protocol; a launcher can show it and open EasyConnected pages with `net.easyconn.start.ec`.
3. Navigation of the linked phone can be mirrored into a launcher HUD card from `net.easyconn.navigation.status`.
4. Never call `EasyConnectProxyService`; never forward `MEDIA_BUTTON` into EasyConnected unless the user is using its music.
5. Sending `BACKING_UP_START/STOP` and day/night to EasyConnected is optional and `[UNTESTED]`: do it only if a bug in phone-link behaviour is observed.

---

## Appendix M — Complete control matrix with exact payloads (revision 3)

Reading guide: **R** = read path, **W** = write/command path. Status uses the document legend: `[VERIFIED]` on the unit, `[CODE]` read in factory sources only, `[NOT AVAILABLE]` proven absent. Every `[CODE]` write is **untested**: ship it behind the reversible self-test in M.3.

### M.1 Wire summary (so nothing has to be rediscovered)
- **MCU write**: `sendInfo(domain, 1, p)` where `p` holds `writeByteArray(jsonBytes)` (transaction 4 on `zhonghong.mcu`; descriptor `android.zhonghong.IMcuService`; request = token, `writeInt(domain)`, `writeInt(1)`, then the raw data of `p`; reply = a single int, 1 = ok).
- **MCU read-all**: `obtainInfo(domain, 1, in, out)` (transaction 3) with `in = writeByteArray("{\"all\":0}")`; reply = `out` data followed by a final int; `out` = `int len, int type(=1), len bytes` and the text is the first `len-1` bytes. **Keyed read**: same with `{"KEY":0}`. `[VERIFIED]`
- **Logic**: standard AIDL on `_logic_service`, descriptor `com.logic.common.aidl.ILogicInterface`: 3 `setCmd(String,String,String)`, 4 `getValue(String,String)`. `[VERIFIED]` for `getValue`; `setCmd` `[CODE]`.

### M.3 Safe self-test the launcher should run before exposing any `[CODE]` write
Run only with the car parked and the user's confirmation; log every result; if any step fails, keep the control hidden and use the fallback.
1. **Volume/EQ keys**: read the current value, write the **same** value, read back; then change by one step, read back, restore the original.
2. **Mute**: read, write `SYS_MUTE=1`, read back, write the original value immediately.
3. **Brightness**: read `screen_brightness`, write the same level, then the adjacent level, restore.
4. **Source switch**: only when nothing is playing: `getSourceId`, `setCmd setSourceId 1` (USB music), read back, restore the previous id.
5. **Radio**: only after the user enables it: step 1 of M.2 row 9, then read domain 1 and **capture the real JSON** (frequency keys were never captured with the radio on).
6. **USB music**: with a USB stick playing, call `playPause` twice and verify `onPlayState`.
7. **Wheel broadcast**: register a receiver for `com.zhonghong.zuiserver.BROADCAST` and log `WHEEL_KEY` values while the owner presses each steering-wheel key once (M.4 channel b).
Success criteria: read-back equals the written value within one step; no exception; the factory UI shows the same state.

### M.4 Steering-wheel and hard keys: three channels `[CODE]`
(a) **Media keys through Logic**: Android media keycodes 85, 86, 87, 88, 126, 127 are routed to the *active audio source's* registered `ILogicCallback.onMediaButtonPressed`. Works only while the launcher holds the audio source (Logic `setSourceId`) **and registered a callback for domain 2** (`registerLogicCallback(2, cb)`); the value is the Android keycode as text. Not yet observed on the unit.
(b) **Broadcast from Logic**: action `com.zhonghong.zuiserver.BROADCAST`, string extra `WHEEL_KEY`. Values seen in the code: `AMS` (key `SEL_DEC` 182), `SEL_RIGHT` (`SEL_INC` 183), `FMAM` (radio key 60/64), `APS` (72), `SCAN` (80), `ENTER` (37), `DPAD_UP` (44), `DIAL` (pick-up 93, dial 95), `HANG_UP` (hang-up 92, dial toggle), `VOICE` (voice key path). A dynamic receiver in the launcher can read these without any binder. Not yet seen on the unit.
(c) **MCU hard-key listener** (domain 4, `McuHardKeyInfo`): raw codes: VOL_INC 23, VOL_DEC 24, MUTE 15, MODE 13, POWER 12, PREV 19, NEXT 20, PLAY_PAUSE 17, PLAY 49, PAUSE 48, FF 21, REW 22, RADIO 60, GPS 120, GPS_NAVI 126, USB 107, DIAL 95, HANG_UP 92, PICK_UP 93, BACK_CALL 169, BACK 171, HOME 172, MENU 173, SCREENSAVE 174, EQ 28, TFT_LAMP 117, TFT_RESUME 84, TFTOFF 1003, ONE_KEY_SAVE 181, SEL_DEC 182, SEL_INC 183, ENTER 37, UP 44, DOWN 45, LEFT 46, RIGHT 47. Factory reactions: USB 107 opens home media; GPS 120 launches navigation (or sends HOME when navigation is on top); keys 171-174/178 only beep (the screen saver toggles on 174); the call-last-number code 231 kills the navigation process and redials; volume keys are handled inside the MCU. The `Instrumentation.sendKeyDownUpSync` helper in Logic injects HOME (3) and BACK (4) for the GPS key.

### M.5 What this system does **not** offer (so nothing stays ambiguous)
CAN control of the car (no sender exists); Bluetooth call control from a custom UI; contacts and call history; USB-video control; wiper, window and passenger-belt data; a six-band equalizer and a `brightness` MCU key; servers for the radio, BT-music, key, multi-screen, navigation and extra-audio-device AIDL interfaces; the AVM/CarLife/power/phone-link apps; any ZhongHong API inside EasyConnected.

## Appendix N — Corrections and resolved questions (revision 3)

| Item | Earlier statement | Verified correction / resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Radio band code | "band 3 = FM, 0 = AM" | The factory `RadioSdk.playFreq` sends `isAMStation(freq) ? 3 : 0`, so **0 = FM, 3 = AM**. Ranges FM 8750-10800 (step 10), AM 522-1620 (step 9) |
| EQ | "six-band EQ40..EQ16k" | Not present in the unit's JSON; only `bass`, `SYS_MID`, `treb` (plus `SYS_USER_*`) |
| Radio level key | `signlevel` and `HAVESIG` | Confirmed names: `signlevel`, `HAVESIG`, `LAGEL_FREG` |
| Odometer | "53342" | Superseded by Appendix I: the full 32-bit value is 34,984,030 raw (34,984 km by the factory conversion). **Unit verified in Appendix O: 1 count = 1 m** |
| Logic callback domains (3.2) | "registers all events whatever the domain" | **Wrong.** Domain 1 = state events, domain 2 = source/media-button events, 3 and 4 not routed (Appendix O) |
| `PowerDistributionStatus` | "2 or 3 = on" | 0 = off, 1 = ACC, 2 = ignition on (running), 3 = cranking (Appendix O) |
| Shifter lever | 9 P, 10 R, 11 N, 12 D | Confirmed repeatedly; also 13 = manual mode and 2-4 = manual gear number while in manual mode (Appendix O) |
| TPMS first reading | 2.30 bar (raw 94) taken as real | Raw 94 on all four wheels is the value held **before** the first sensor update; real readings after driving were 1.93-2.09 bar (Appendix O) |
| EasyConnected "API discovery" (Appendix J, P2) | open | Resolved in Appendix L: broadcast protocol only, no ZhongHong API, no AVRCP metadata |
| Steering-wheel signals | open | Three channels documented in M.4; none yet observed on the unit |
| Hard keys BACK/HOME/MENU | assumed to inject Android keys | In Logic they only beep; injection exists only for the GPS key (HOME/BACK) |
| Brightness write | unknown | Factory path is `Settings.System screen_brightness` (five levels) plus day/night keys and an apply broadcast (M.2 row 7) |
| Passenger airbag | "control" | Status only in the factory SRS page; no control path in code |

## Appendix O — Full-drive field test (31 October 2026, revision 4)

**Method and honesty about the evidence.** `CarCheck` v1.1 ran for 2,519 s (about 42 minutes, 496 five-second samples) while the owner drove a short route (about 1 km, maximum 65 km/h), used the lights, doors, trunk, locks, winter mode, rear defroster, child lock, ignition button (five ACC/ignition cycles), a reverse manoeuvre several times, four short Bluetooth calls, USB music and the volume controls. **No marker button was pressed**, so every conclusion below comes from the timestamps of the CAN changes, from physics (speed vs odometer) and from cross-correlation with Logic and broker events. Items that rest on a pattern rather than on a labelled action are marked *(pattern)*. The log had **zero** exceptions or timeouts, and the sampling thread never missed a beat (largest gap between samples 5.6 s) through all five ignition cycles, so the keep-alive service survives ACC off/on of a few seconds. A long ACC-off sleep was not tested.

### O.1 Items that were open and are now resolved
| Item | Result | How it was established |
|---|---|---|
| Vehicle speed unit | **`Vehicle_Speed` (frame 1218 byte 5) is km/h** | Integrating the 37 moving samples gave 1.02 km; the odometer advanced by 1,013 counts over the same time |
| Odometer unit | **one raw count = 1 metre** (so km = raw / 1000, matching the factory screen's divide-by-1000) | same comparison: 1.02 km vs 1,013 counts. The low 16 bits went from 19,520 to 20,533; the earlier run showed 53,342 (wrap-around of the low half: 31.7 km were driven between the two runs). Use the full 32-bit value of Appendix I |
| Gear lever values | **9 = P, 10 = R, 11 = N, 12 = D** (repeated 8 times; `back_state` true exactly while the value is 10). **13 = manual/sequential mode entered from D; 2, 3, 4 = manual gear number shown while in that mode** *(pattern: 12→13→4→3→2→12 during a deceleration from about 46 to 13 km/h)* | sequence and speeds |
| Power chain | `PowerDistributionStatus` (577): **0 = off, 1 = ACC, 2 = ignition on, 3 = cranking**. `Start_Switch_Status` (564) follows it (0 off, 1 first press = ACC, 2 = ON, 3 = start). `ACCRelaySt`, `IG1RelaySt`, `IG2RelaySt` are 1 when energised. At power-off the order was: IG1/IG2 relays drop, `PowerDistributionStatus` 2→1→0, ACC relay drops, and Logic raised `onAccStateChanged=false`; Logic raised `true` when `PowerDistributionStatus` returned to 1 | five ignition cycles |
| `KeyPositionStatus` | a short pulse (about 5 s) after every ignition-state change and during door events: **ignore it** | correlation |
| Trunk | `Trunk_Lid_Switch_Status` (564 bit 4): **0 = open, 1 = closed** *(pattern: it starts 1→0 and ends 0→1, six open/close cycles)*. `Trunk_Output__Status` (963) = 1 while the release actuator fires; `PKE_RKE_LuggageUnlockSignal` (577) = 1 on the remote luggage-unlock key | six cycles |
| Bonnet | never changed (not exercised) | - |
| Passenger belt | never changed in 42 minutes: no sensor (matches the owner) | - |
| Airbag flags | `Error_flag_of_the_airbag_ECU` and `Passenger_airbag_cut_off_status` (frame 722) both read **1 for about 6 s after each ignition-on, then 0** (prove-out lamp test; observed at three of the five ignition cycles). **A launcher must ignore them for the first 10 s after ignition and treat only a sustained 1 as a warning.** No steady toggling of the cut-off was seen | timeline |
| Wipers, windows | no front-wiper or window field ever changed; `Rear_Wiper_Output_Status` showed 2 for 14-30 s only around ignition cycling. **Do not offer wiper or window features** | whole drive |

### O.2 New signals understood
| Signal (frame) | Meaning (value 1 unless stated) |
|---|---|
| `Daylight_Status` (963) | **Daytime-running-lamp state**: 1 with the engine on and lights off; 0 while the parking/low-beam lamps are on and while the ignition is off |
| `Position_Lamp_Status` (963) | on exactly while Logic's `onIllStateChanged` is true (within 0.6 s) |
| `Low_Beam_Status`, `High_Beam_Status` (963) | on only during the low/high-beam parts of the test; position lamps were on for the whole lights period |
| `Winter_Mode_Status` (1218) | 1 = winter mode on (toggled on-off-on-off by the owner) *(pattern)* |
| `Transmission_Warning_Lamp` (1218) | 1 for about 2 s as part of the ignition prove-out; sustained 1 would be a real warning |
| `Screen_Heater_Switch_Status` (564) | momentary pulse (rear-defroster button); `Screen_Heater_Relay__Status` (963) = 1 while the heater is on *(pattern)* |
| `Horn_Switch_Status` (564) | pulse while the horn button is pressed; `Horn_Relay__Status` (963) also fires for the remote-lock confirmation beep |
| `Child_Lock_LED_Indicator_Output_Status` (963) | 1 while the child lock is engaged *(pattern)* |
| `Start_Stop_Green_LED_Output_Status` (963) | 1 while the start button LED is lit (ignition on) |
| `Left/Right_Indicator_Lamp_Status`, `Buzzer_Output__Status` (963) | blink states (148/47/413 changes); never use a single reading |
| `FLH_Actuator_Switch_Status` (564) | pulsed three times at 948-967 s; meaning unknown (not needed) |
| `PEPS_ICMInd` (577) 4/5, `PEPS_ICMAlarm`, `Anti_theft_status_indication`, `IGSwitchSteerlockStatus` | cluster-message and anti-theft state machine around ignition; not needed by a launcher |

### O.3 Tyre readings (real values after the car moved)
Raw pressure values: FL 94→71, 69, 67, 68; FR 94→68, 67, 69; RL 94→69, 71; RR 94→78, 79. Using `bar = ceil(raw*1.378+100)/100`: 67 = 1.93, 68 = 1.94, 69 = 1.96, 71 = 1.98, 78 = 2.08, 79 = 2.09, 94 = 2.30. Raw temperatures 59-67 = 19-27 °C. **Rule:** every run started with exactly 94 on all four wheels; that is the value held before the first sensor update (sensors report when the car moves). **Ignore a TPMS reading until its raw value has changed at least once after power-on, or until the TPMS frame has been re-notified.** Ambient temperature over the drive: raw 118-126 = 19-23 °C. Status fields stayed 0.

### O.4 Services and events seen during the drive
| Source | Observation |
|---|---|
| Logic domain 1 | `onBackStateChanged` true/false 11 pairs (reverse), `onIllStateChanged` 6 pairs, `onAccStateChanged` 6 pairs. No other event types appeared |
| Logic domains 2-4 | nothing arrived: domain 2 was not registered by the probe (source/media-button events); domains 3 and 4 are not routed in this build (see section 3.2) |
| System-state broker | `back` 1/0 (same instants as Logic), `acc` 0/1 (same instants as Logic), `volume` values 9..14 and back down to 10 (hardware and steering buttons), `btPhoneState` (below) |
| `btPhoneState` | four short calls, each produced three events: two callbacks `0` then `2` at the start, a second `0`/`2` pair about 2.5 s later, and `7` then `3` at the end. `sys.btcall` was `true` for the call and `false` afterwards (`<unset>` before the first call). The two values of a pair arrive in the same millisecond; **act on the second value of each pair**, and use `sys.btcall` as the active flag |
| USB music listener | 23 events: `playState` 1/0 flicker and `id3` callbacks (title length 62/52/48, album length 8/15, artist empty). The listener works. Because `playState` flickers on track changes, **call `isPlaying()` (code 3) after each event** instead of trusting the pair |
| MCU | `SYS_VOL` read 8 at start (the broker later reported 9-14); `SYS_MUTE` is returned as text `false`/`true`, not 0/1; `MCU_SOURCE` = 15, `MCU_STATE` = 512; radio JSON still `status:"off"`. Keyed reads of keys that do not exist (`brightness`, `EQ1k`) and the no-input read return `ok=0` as before |
| Persistence | the process stayed alive through 5 ACC-off/on cycles, 42 minutes and a Bluetooth call sequence |

### O.5 Rules that replace earlier recommendations
1. **Speed:** use CAN `Vehicle_Speed` (km/h, verified) as the primary source, with GPS as fallback when the CAN frame is missing. The first-drive calibration algorithm of the earlier revision is no longer required; keep a cheap sanity check (if CAN reads 0 while GPS > 10 km/h for 5 s, switch to GPS).
2. **Odometer:** show `raw32 / 1000` km (Appendix I decode). The unit is verified.
3. **Gear display:** P/R/N/D from 9/10/11/12; any other value (13, 2-4) shows as manual mode (with the number when 2-4 is seen).
4. **Ignition/power:** state machine from `PowerDistributionStatus` (0/1/2/3) or the Logic/broker ACC events; ignore `KeyPositionStatus`.
5. **Airbag/transmission warning lamps:** 10-second grace after ignition, then require a sustained value.
6. **Tyres:** ignore the first 94 reading; show a "waiting for sensors" state until a value changes.
7. **Drivetrain extras that are safe to show:** DRL state, winter mode, rear-defroster state, child-lock LED, horn, remote lock/unlock and luggage-release events, trunk and doors (0 = open).
8. **Logic callbacks:** register domain 1 and domain 2.
9. **Not to be built:** wipers, windows, passenger belt, bonnet (unverified), contacts, call history, answer/reject/dial from a custom UI.
10. **Phone state:** `sys.btcall` for active, broker `btPhoneState` second value for start/end; no names or numbers are available.
